if you guys have ever wondered how you guys are going to end up making generational wealth or just stop living paycheck to paycheck worrying about rent
that's due in a month or a week from now and you guys know for a fact that in 2025 the digital age the internet age of
Internet money where you see 17 18 22y olds making millions a month and you're
thinking how can I get in on this you've tried multiple different side hustles you guys have attempted something for a
month and then you guys stopped you guys have tried something for a week and then you're like ah this is too hard I don't want to do it anymore and trust me I've
been there before I've gone through all the side hustles so I understand where you guys are at but don't worry because
I've gone through all of the BS that you guys have gone through and if I was able
to make it out I know for a fact that I can help you guys make it out with just this video today so with that being said
let me guide you let me hopefully grab your hands and show you the way that you
guys can actually make a [ __ ] ton of money in 2025 now let me give you guys a little backstory of where I was at
before you guys knew me for who I am tjr trade tjr okay regular people in my life
don't even call me tjr they call me Tyler and by the end of this video you guys are going to be able to call me Tyler because we're going to know each
other pretty freaking well okay so let me give you guys some perspective of where I was at before all of this online
money thing was real for me so I started off in crypto in high school okay and I
got into it I got really freaking lucky I made a bunch of money but then I lost it all and that sparked this huge crazy
fascination with making money and it didn't just jump from that just straight
into trading and then boom billionaire like no that's that's not how it worked okay I went from that to reselling shoes
like I bought multiple sneaker Bots and I was reselling Yeezys I had a whole bunch of Yeezys coming in the house I
had a supreme bot I literally would on every single Thursday because I was on PST okay I can't remember what time the
Supreme drops happened at but I remember skipping the first 15 minutes of my
first period class on Thursday so I could cook on the Supreme drop and I remember the North Face Supreme collab
dropped and I cooked on like these three hoodies and I was like no way I'm freaking rich and then I wasn't Rich
because I ended up losing a bunch of money on several other drops so trust me I have been through a whole bunch of
these different side hustles and things until I found what worked for me I mean even bro I even thought about doing
Section 8 housing I thought about doing real estate I tried doing Drop Shipping for like 2 seconds I tried doing the
Snapchat Creator method I actually made $3,000 doing that which was pretty cool but it wasn't actual sustainable money
that could literally be consistent income on a monthly basis and then after all of that I was like wait H I already
made a bunch of money with crypto why and like I you know I just got sucked backed into the space there was something that was so fascinating about
it to me so I was like okay I'm going to get back into this I want to start learning about this some more so what do I do do I just start watching YouTube
videos I'm going down the rabbit hole I was literally watching a YouTube video that is the like pretty much the exact same type of YouTube video that you're
watching right now of me it's weird cuz I'm explaining the YouTube video that I was watching and you guys are now watching that same exact YouTube video
where it was like literally 2 hours long and it's like hello this is the beginner guy today trading and this is one pair
and then you buy low and then you sell high and boom you're making money okay we're going to get way more advanced than that I'm going to actually make
sure you guys are taken care of because after that 2hour video I was like bro I still don't know how to trade and you
honestly just left me with a whole bunch of information that now I don't know what to do with so I'm not going to do that to you guys I'm going to make this
way easier than what I had to do what I had to do is I had to put in a whole bunch of time a whole bunch of effort
sorting through all these YouTube videos trying to figure out what works what doesn't and now I'm going to lay this
all out for you guys so you guys don't have to sort through all those BS YouTube videos and you guys can just
watch one single YouTube video where I teach you everything about trading I even teach you the strategy about trading and you guys won't have to watch
literally anything else it's going to be awesome okay now before we get into just day trading A to Z and we start talking
about all of this educational stuff I want to give you guys the option to compare and contrast some of these other online making money methods in 2025 okay
so there's a whole bunch of different ways that lots of people are like oh yeah let me start the side hustle and then once the side hustle starts making
me more money than my real job then I'm able to quit my real job and then boom billionaire right so that's what
everybody wants but it's not as simple as that and it's not as simple as trading okay and it's not as simple as
Drop Shipping regardless these side hustles are going to take time and effort however some of them are going to
take more time more effort and most of all a whole bunch of money to get started so I want to break down these
side hustles just in case trading might not be for you okay if trading isn't for you that's fine I just saved you
literally like however long this video is like [ __ ] 5 hours I just saved you 5 hours worth of your time but if you do
think trading is for you and we go over all these other side hustle so we can actually like confirm like okay we're not going to play these games on Drop
Shipping okay Alibaba Express we're not doing that [ __ ] today okay we're just learning about day trading we're sticking to that all right so let's
think about it e-commerce okay whole bunch of money up front and I'm assuming the majority of you guys again like we
said we're living paycheck to paycheck we're freaking broke right now we do not have a whole bunch of money to be starting a brand new business a brand
new freaking brand okay a company we don't have the money to be doing that yet why it's a bunch of upfront costs
and it's low margins like regardless of when you start and how you scale it's upfront costs and low margins just no
matter what you're paying a whole bunch of money regardless of if you're low capital or high Capital you're still
going to be paying a lot of money and you're still going to have low margins to start ever heard of affiliate marketing yeah neither have I and it's
for a good freaking reason you ever heard of a millionaire that's an affiliate marketer I haven't get out of here copyrighting bro the amount of DMS
I'm look I'm rich and famous or I mean I think I'm a little bit famous but the amount of people that I get in my DMs
that say Hey I'm a copywriter do you need me bro no I don't so if that answers your question on if you think
being becoming a copywriter I'm somebody that would be considered like a very high ticket client for a copywriter
right do I use a copywriter no do any of my friends that are rich and famous use copywriters no so do I think
copyrighting is for you no and I can tell you when I tried to do copywriting it did not work out I could not land a
client to save my life it's a whole bunch of DMS to all these famous people they leave you on red they don't even see your [ __ ] and if by the look of the
draw you're able to sign them they're trying to rinse you out of a whole bunch of time for as little money as possible
so we'll leave that one alone but what skill out of all of these side hustles
is literally infinitely scalable day trading why is day trading
infinitely scalable because the only thing that you're limited by is your capital and luckily there's a whole
whole bunch of companies out there in the world that can help us leverage the small amount of capital that we have
right now to be able to trade with higher capital and I'll get into that later in this video but just know if you guys are like broke right now you guys
don't have a whole bunch of money there are people that are just like you that go from not having anything to literally
making 20 $30,000 in their first months of becoming a profitable Trader so if that
gives you the perspective of what we can do with trading oh yeah it's big time okay and then not only that why is it
infinitely scalable because you're only limited by your own Capital so let's say I have a billion dollars and I'm a
profitable Trader bankroll okay but when it comes to e-commerce there's only a certain
amount of people in the population yes you could sell to every single person in the population but you're still limited
to the population size you're still limited to the niche but trading no the only thing that you're limited by is
your Capital so you're telling me if I learn the skill of day trading I have an infinitely scalable skill yes that's why
day trading is literally one of the most powerful and one of the most useful skills in the freaking world and on top
of that this isn't no Drop Shipping one product one hit wonder once you learn the skill of day trading you're set for
freaking life and I don't I don't want to like Gaslight you guys into that because day trading it's one of the
hardest skills in the world but assuming that you guys are already living a hard life you guys already work hard in your
jobs what if we just take all that hard work and put it into day trading I can almost promise you that you'll be able
to get out on top just like I was able to get out on top just like all these other people were able to get out on top and again I'm not trying to convince you
that this is going to be a super easy path but I am saying that day trading by far is the highest leverage skill in
this make money online space you saw all of these meme coin day Traders go from literally broke college students to
multi8 figure several millions of dollars in just a couple months now
crypto is a whole different story and I'll explain later in this video why we want to stay away from crypto just because it's too volatile there's
seasons for it but day trading on the other hand the Market's always going to show up okay the Market's going to show
up whether you're in it or not and that's why day trading is so special that's why day trading is the highest
leverage skill especially in the year of 2025 for us to be able to learn and once
you learn it you already know we're set for life bank roll I'm sure a lot of you
guys are Wonder ing like okay bet I I know I know trading is bankroll we know trading is is bankroll okay tjr we know
it we know it we know it's the best skill ever okay but I want to give you guys some reassurance okay cuz I'm sure
a lot of you guys are seeing me like in this freaking cave and you're like damn this guy probably has [ __ ] 1 2 3 4 S
monitors and he's just [ __ ] you know breaker 129 3 4 5 6 7 okay yes we have a
break of structure on the NASDAQ we're entering Longs okay you that's what you probably think day trading is it's not
okay and it's funny because I didn't even start copying setups like this until I started doing YouTube to be able
to film videos like this prior to this I was literally just trading on my iPhone
I had my charts on my phone I had my brokerage on my phone okay I was doing
literally everything on my phone and the only time that I started using a computer for trading was when I started
making YouTube videos cuz how else was I going to film it I couldn't film a YouTube video on my phone so that's a
huge part about day trading it's like the accessibility to be able to work on your phone from anywhere in the world as
long as you have cellular data or a Wi-Fi connection you can do this anywhere and also shout out Elon okay
T-Mobile just partnered with starlink you can literally be on Mars and be day trading So eventually when we take that
ship up there what are the drop shippers going to do okay they ain't Drop Shipping to Mars you know what I'm going
to be doing I'm still trading I'm trading rocket ships up there okay I know that's a that's a funny joke
whatever but I'm just telling you that the accessibility that trading has compared to everything else it's
GameChanger okay not only that is the flexibility okay I'm going to explain
right after this that there are multiple sessions within the market as a whole okay whether you're day trading us
equities whether you're trading foreign exchange whether you're trading Commodities whether you're trading
crypto there is a time zone a pair and we're going to get into this and a
session for every single person no matter where you are in the world to be able to be trading at whatever time
doesn't that sound freaking awesome that's what enticed me about trading because I was like man I'm on Pacific
Standard time I'm all the way over here in California and Market opens at 6:30 a.m. and I'm just a I'm a sleepy head I
didn't back then I I didn't want to wake up early so I was like screw that all stay up late and I'll trade London session at 12: or 1 at night and that
works for me if you're in Europe New York session it's opening I think it's like in the middle of the night for you
guys but what do you guys have London session it's awesome okay there's something for everybody okay and then on top of that the scalability we already
talked about that what is trading bankroll okay why is it bankroll because trading is by far the highest leverage
skill that you can learn in today's day and age why because the only thing that you are limited by is your own capital
and just like I said before I know you guys are thinking well I ain't got no bankroll I ain't got no Capital don't worry there are companies that help you
guys solve this problem okay and there's a whole bunch of softwares and
it I I love trading so much and I can talk about it for hours and I am going to talk about it for hours to you guys
and I locked myself in this room today so I can explain to you guys why I love trading so much and hopefully by the end
of this video I can transfer the skill to you guys so hopefully I either won scared off all the Nerds that don't
think day trading is going to get them rich in 2025 hopefully I brought in everybody who thinks day trading will help them get rich and is the highest
leverage skill that they can learn in 2025 and with that being said let's learn how to [ __ ] day trade in 2025
baby there are around 30 different types of trading okay I'm going to teach you
guys the most common which is day trading okay which means we are entering into trades within the same day and we
are exiting trades within the same day okay there's a whole bunch of different types of trading there's technical
trading there's momentum trading there's algorithmic trading there's swing trading there's fundamental trading there's a whole bunch of different typ
typ of trading but honestly those never worked out for me I attempted some of them and most of all they're just way
more confusing than just the regular most common form of day trading which is
getting in and getting out within the same day and then what trading bankroll so for everybody that doesn't know
anything about day trading don't worry I'm going to break it down ready on the chart when it's low you want to buy it
and then when it goes High you want to sell it boom you're rich thank you guys for watching I'm I'm kidding I'm kid
okay but on top of that the nice thing about day trading I feel like a lot of people don't understand this they're like what happens if uh the market goes
down you can't trade that day well yes you can that's actually called a short position so you can actually sell when
it's up high and then buy those shares back for a lesser price and you can
actually still make money doing that so there's two different types of positions that we can take we can take a buy
position or we can take a sell position M pretty cool so that's another nice thing about day trading and that's why I
said I want to stay away from the crypto because crypto most of the time you're only making money buying for the most
part unless you're doing leverage trading blah blah blah we don't want to talk about that but for day trading for
us we have accessibility on both sides so that's why day trading is such a high leverage skill because not only can we
buy low sell High we can sell high and then buy back lower and make money in
either direction of the market so let's say the market crashes no housing crash
2008 ra what happens what happens if the price goes down well you can still make money and that's why day trading is the
highest leverage skill that you guys can have because when everybody's panicking financial crisis we're still getting rich now I want to break down because
again this is like bare minimum base level of trading expertise required here
like just how do you make money from Trading and I know explain like you buy low and you sell high but I'm going to
do a little high school teacher here for you play the economics teacher in high school I'm going to teach you guys about
the stock market okay let's say little Timmy I am Timmy wants to buy one share of Apple I don't even know how much a
share of Apple is but let's say it's worth a hundred bucks just for Simplicity s okay I go to my little
brokerage on my phone and I say cck buy one share of Apple back in the olden days and the reason why I have to
explain this back in the olden days is because this is still how our system works it's just digitalized and it's
simplified for us which is better for us because we're able to do these transactions super fast but back in the
day when you wanted to buy a share of Apple you would have to make several different phone calls to like The
Brokerage to the New York Stock Exchange whatever and then they would ship in the mail like your actual freaking paper
share and then it's like boom I have my share and then you would have to like call in every day or whatever however
many days that you own that share and you're like hey has price gone up yet or oh no is is my share worth less money
like what do I do that's how it worked in the olden days is okay you would get this piece of paper and it would say like boom you own one share of Apple all
right and your share is worth a certain price and price fluctuates on a whole bunch of different things okay it
fluctuates based off of news it fluctuates based off of price action which is what I'm going to be teaching you guys how to read and when you wanted
to sell ideally you're selling for a higher price so let's say me little Timmy goes calls his little brokerage
and says hey I want to buy a share of Apple for $100 obviously I can't just
name my price but let's say Apple's share price is worth $100 today then following that 2 months later whatever
the most crazy news in the entire world about Apple Apple drops a time machine
and boom two months later Apple's stock is now worth three times more than what I bought it at so it's now worth 300
bucks then I call on my brokerage and say Hey I want to sell my share boom we sell the share what do I make 200 bucks
awesome lit right we can do the same thing but now it's digitalized on our phones so instead of calling a bunch of
phone numbers we just have these brokerages and these exchanges within our phone that can connect to super cool
applications like trading view which I'm going to teach you guys how to set up I'm going to teach you guys how to figure out what brokerage to sign up
with okay I'm going to teach you guys what trading platforms you guys can sign up with so we can do these transactions
at the speed of freaking light okay at the speed of tapping a button and the nice thing about that is we're able to
get in and get out with Precision so we're not waiting for our Brokers to get off the line and say like boom you sold
and then like oh price drops a little bit oh damn I I made less money no we're getting in and we're getting out with the tap of a button and that's why day
trading is so great now because we're doing it on our phones and the age of technology is just taking us so much
farther and that's why it's so much easier to make money online but I know that sounds super crazy and I know that sounds like you got to be some freaking
genius but look at me I'm I'm a [ __ ] and I make a [ __ ] ton of money
from trading on a day-to-day basis and on a L basis and on a yearly basis so if a [ __ ] can do it sorry for using the
hard R you can do it too and I'm sure the majority of you guys are smarter than me so I'm sure the majority of you
guys will be able to get really good at this and probably better than me in the future which is awesome I'm I'm this is
why I do the [ __ ] so you guys can be just like me except not [ __ ] it's
awesome it's great so don't get overwhelmed I know brokerage exchange
tapping buttons byy low sell okay I know it seems overwhelming but I'm going to cover all that in this video and how you
guys can do it how you guys can do it boom just like this and start today start learning the skill of day trading that is again the highest leverage skill
in the world so with that being said we'll get into the three best tools that
you guys need to start your day training career and I'll go over all the websites all the apps that you guys need to download so you guys can get started all
right let's get into it the very first and quite possibly the most important tool that you guys are going to be using
in day trading is called TR trading view this is where you guys are going to be seeing all your charts how to buy low
and sell High okay this is where you guys are going to be using your strategy yes there is a strategy with day trading
and don't worry I'm going to teach you a strategy at once we get all these tools figured out and set up for you guys because we need to set those up first so
the first tool is going to be trading VI not only do they have an app on your phone but they also have the website on
the computer if you guys are on your phone I highly recommend you guys download their app and don't use the website if you guys are on a computer I
don't think they have a app for the computer but they just have their website I use Chrome and it's perfect so
what you guys are going to do I know we have whatever we got Roger freaking Federer with Mount Rushmore on the back
I I couldn't tell you why we got this [ __ ] going on right now who even is this dude but we're we're getting started by
staring at him okay so what are we going to do get started for free that's another great thing about trading view
you guys again I told you guys no upfront costs okay there's not many upfront costs you guys can literally start learning the skill of day trading
for Frey that's why trading is bankroll okay so you guys are going to go ahead
and click get started for free from there it's going to say oh free until you're ready bet $0 forever what is that
talk about bankroll talk about saving money we're not drop shiing into Alibaba okay we're not going to China and we're
not using the Shane Factory we're just using the computers that they made okay
that's it that's the only sort of child okay that's it we're done okay continuing sign up it's going to end up
once you guys sign in whether you're using your Gmail whatever whatever account you guys want it's going to bring you guys to a screen like this and
say buy my course okay no we're not going to do that okay we're going to just fully avoid that we're going to go
over to markets here and then we can just go to indexes oops whatever let's just click on
indexes cool so boom charts Buy Low sell
hat no not yet Timmy we're not there yet God man why you always is jumping ahead
stop jumping ahead okay so this is indexes we see the S&P 500 we see the
NASDAQ NASDAQ smoking on that gas pack smoking off your ass crack okay we have
the Dow Jones okay whatever and then we got look for foreign exchange we got Euro USD GBP USD USD JPY I'm going to be
explaining how all of these pairs work later on okay so I know this all seems overwhelming what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and click on the S&P 500 and then you're still saying wait where's the chart is it this thing down
here tjr how am I supposed to read this no no no timy we're clicking see on
super charts Superman super charts super farts let's get into this bang look at
that okay your chart isn't going to look as sexy as this because I've already
custom designed my chart to look really freaking good okay you guys don't have
that luxury just yet but what I am going to do is show you guys how you guys can make your chart look just like mine with
these beautiful blue and black candles if you guys aren't discriminatory to
Candle color that's fine what you guys are going to do is you guys are going to go ahead and rightclick on the chart and
then you guys are going to scroll down to settings and then you guys can set it up with whatever colors okay you guys
can do red you guys can do green you guys can do yellow you know you guys can
do [ __ ] black on black you know I I'm hey bro if you like that you like that
you can do Wi on black get a little light skin in there okay you guys can do that however you guys like okay these
are my chart settings most of the time your chart is going to look pretty freaking disgusting at the start and
it's going to be like green red there's going to be a whole bunch of BS in the background okay so let me go through
here I'm pretty sure this is somewhat important we have like the previous day close that we want to hide so I'll just
go ahead and you guys can cop this you guys can change it however you guys want just make it look pretty okay that's one of the things that I value the most
about my charts is like first and foremost I I want my charts to be clean if if my chart isn't clean and you guys
will understand as you guys get better at at trading and as we get deeper into
this video you guys are going to be like wow how does he keep his chart like clean and tidy whatever because it can
get really overwhelming so let's go into canvas I have just background solid white grid Lines no grid lines sometimes
like like look it you know it has these nasty ass grid lines I don't like the grid lines Crosshair is just boom
straight up and then Trading alerts and events you guys don't have to care about that so boom once you guys have your
charts looking nice and sexy we are going to actually put a pin in trading
view for now now that we have trading view set up we're going to put a pin in it and I'm going to explain these little
candle s are how to read them what they mean okay and I'm going to be explaining
these foreign change pairs I'm going to be explaining Commodities gold I'll even explain crypto for a little bit okay and
we're going to understand what all this means how we can read it how we can actually make money from this Market but
in order for us to make money we actually have to be set up with a brokerage where we can deposit money where we can withdraw money and where we
we can actually execute these trades because on trading view we're not doing any of that this is just where we're
just marking [ __ ] up okay we need a brokerage again remember little Timmy he calls his brokerage and he says hey can
I buy the shares this is how we're going to be buying and selling selling and buying okay so with that being said
let's jump over to how to find a brokerage how to get how to get set up on a trading platform because this is
our chartwork platform I'm going to show you guys how you guys can get set up on a trading platform all right so there's
a plethora like literally millions of different brokerages that you guys can go through in order to start trading and
start trading on their platform start trading on their apps on your phone start trading on the apps on their apps
on your computer okay it really just depends on what suits you best okay and what platform or what brokerage you
think best suits you okay so I personally don't trade options so options is out of the park for me if you
guys wanted came here to learn about options byebye okay um I'm not going to teach you guys about options in here but
I am going to teach you guys a really solid strategy on how to actually make money in trading so if you guys want to apply that to options by all means but
I'm not going to teach you guys how to set up an options trading account okay I'm going to be teaching you guys how to actually get started with just day
trading okay using leverage on your own Capital just through the account not
like leveraging specific positions okay so the brokerage that I use is hero effects that's the one that works the
best for me okay I trade indexes and then occasionally I'll trade foreign exchange so that's what works best for
me sometimes these Futures brokerages have really strict regulations on the
type of Leverage that you guys can use and especially if you guys are lower Capital individuals and you guys are
just getting it started in day trading these big brokerages like trade evade
and trade station you just straight up won't be able to trade on them because you guys don't have enough money to
trade with them so instead you guys would go over to a cfd brokerage such as hero effects where you guys can leverage
your money more and be able to actually start trading with less money again you guys can literally just type in trading
brokerage look through like a whole bunch of all of these different brokerages find out what works best for you me personally I use hero effects
they're great I can deposit I can withdraw within like seconds and it works great for me so with that being
said I'm going to go onto the hero effects dashboard and show you guys how to get set up on there again if you guys
want to go through a different brokerage that's completely fine I'm just not really going to go over that okay so
with that being said let's jump onto hero effect's website also I'll leave a little Link in the description I have a little affiliate with them um so if you
guys want to sign up with hero effect and if you guys appreciate all the info that I've been giving with you guys it would be a huge support if if you guys
just signed up with my link right underneath here in the description and yeah they're super solid Brokers for me I trade on them consistently and have
been trading with them for a while so let's get into it so once you guys go through that link it'll have you guys
sign up and whatever and it's going to take you guys to a page that looks like this and this is all the different tra trading platforms this is also why I
love hero effects is because they literally give you a various like multiple different types of apps
websites and different trading platforms to trade on versus other again big brokerage is they don't give you guys
any sort of variety they're like hey you have to use this one specific platform and it's like what if that platform
sucks luckily hero effect gives you literally as so many options okay me
personally I use trade locker and I like trading on the app so again you would just go on your phone you can literally
just look up trade Locker in the app store and then go ahead and download that and then they will give you guys an
email once you guys have signed up your account details and your password as you guys can see I have 35 freaking th000
just sitting in my wallet balance right now this is going to be useful because I can either deposit this in back into a
live account because this is just sitting on my dashboard wallet okay it's not in my trading account and it's not
in my bank account yet so this is just the in between this is why a broker like her effect effect is super useful
because again they have different withdraw methods okay you can withdraw in crypto you can do like bank transfer
just a whole bunch of methods and it's great and especially for me I'm pretty I'm I love crypto and I like investing
in it so when I withdraw most time I just do it through crypto and it hits in literally seconds so for me I do it
through the trade Locker app they will send you guys a little email with your account username with your account
password and you guys just go onto the app you guys plug in your username and password and it's locked in from there
again they have a whole bunch of different trading platforms that you guys can use if you guys are on PC or
laptop whatever you guys can do the web Trader which is it brings up a little tab where you guys can trade on trade
Locker there and if you guys want to trade on desktop there's literally like a full-on app called trade Locker that
you guys can download and then it's the same login process they're going to send you guys an email you guys are going to get your username and password you guys
are going to log in and then from there you guys will be all set okay on top of that while we're on the talking about
brokerages not only is a brokerage super useful for us to be able to deposit and
withdraw money right that's our end goal with day trading is to what bankroll right but before we can even get started
with the bankroll we need to learn learn the skill of day trading right how are we going to learn the skill of day trading like we don't want to just throw
money into the pit off rip we don't want to do that and again like a lot of

are going to click on it and then it's going to say Live account no no Live accounts yet we need to learn
the skill of trading okay we need to learn the skill of trading first there's Live accounts and then there's demo
accounts we want the demo okay we want that fake money we want to learn the
skill of trading without having to risk money that's like the a good comparison of this is like you having never played
basketball before in your life and you go to the black top with like a th000 bucks in your pocket you've never played
basketball before in your life and you go up to people that are playing really good players and you're like yo I got a
bando for whoever's trying to run ones you slap that [ __ ] down and then what do you do you [ __ ] lose obviously why
cuz it's your first time playing basketball it's your first time trading versus if you just show up to the park
with no bread and you just keep playing until you get good until you get really
[ __ ] good and then you switch over from the demo to the Bando in the pocket
slap that [ __ ] down and now you're cooking the 60-year-old that's got ankle braces on and you're hitting them with
that [ __ ] jelly okay sorry that was a little that was we're getting off off
track here but you you get what I'm saying the demo account it's where we want to go okay so again I use trade
Locker there's a whole bunch of different like whatever configurations
there's demo zero okay which means low spreads and zero commission there's demo raw
dog okay sorry that means raw spreads and fixed commissions okay and then
there's or those are the only two for trade Locker okay me personally I do low
spreads and no commission you guys can you guys can choose whichever one you guys like again you guys don't really
know much about this I I would just go with demo zero okay that's the that's the best one that works for me cuz I
prefer low spreads and zero commissions than fixed commission and raw spreads I I don't like to get [ __ ] raw I would
rather you know wrap it and tap it you know what I'm saying and okay we're getting way too confused here demo
account we got it set up same thing here we're going to click on the account and then boom once we set up that account
herox is going to send you an email and say boom you got your username you got your password you're locked the [ __ ] in go to trade Locker sign in bling blow
and then we're going to be signed in and now let's go over to trade Locker so I can show you guys how to actually
execute trades and don't worry we're going to get into understanding the charts we're going to get into
understanding the craziness of trading view but I need to explain all these softwares and gizmos and gadgets first
so you guys can understand this [ __ ] before we get in cuz what what would happen if I just say like yo this is the
trading strategy and I just Blitz through everything and then I say yeah go figure out how to find find these charts online somewhere go figure out
how to actually set up a brokerage somewhere go figure go figure it out little baby [ __ ] yeah I'm not going to
teach you that [ __ ] no I am going to teach you that [ __ ] and I'm strapping myself in this [ __ ] chair for the
next seven hours so you guys can learn this [ __ ] okay Timmy you're going to [ __ ] learn the highest leverage skill
in the world you're going to learn this [ __ ] whether you like it or not so you better lock the [ __ ] in Timmy let's get
on trade Locker you [ __ ] uh sorry Timmy I forgot to tell you one thing before we get on the trade Locker when it says
deposit to demo count are you guys going to end up depositing like is this real
money no so if I want to be a quadrillionaire with fake money I can
but just to like teach you guys like you guys can just start with like just do
like 10 whoa what the hell just do like $110,000 to start okay 10,000 is like
[ __ ] fine okay just so you guys have enough capital to be able to take like hella trades and again you guys can
change this however you guys want is it going to ask you to deposit money no it's not going to have you deposit any
any bread this is just imaginary fake money how much imaginary fake money do you want I want $100
billion I want 100 billion rupees sorry guys we we've already been
locked up for too damn long we're going to do $100,000 okay 10 man let's deposit
this [ __ ] in the demo account and let's get going all right bet so it's going to take us through here and then boom jump
scare this is our day trading account okay as you guys can see it says demo right here this is fake money we have
$100,000 worth of fake money so now you guys are probably overwhelmed we're looking at a crypto chart right now we
don't want to be looking at a crypto chart but eventually when we get back over here to trading View and we're
analyzing pairs like Euro USD ideally we are going to be pulling up okay let's do
foreign exchange Majors they're blacked out because the Market's closed right now it's a Sunday but look we have the
same exact chart that we are looking at on trading view so we're actually able to execute trades on trade Locker while
looking see it's the same chart boom EUR USD Euro USD so the only thing that
we're using this for is to execute trades okay and again they have an app
on your phone where you guys can execute trades as well and we're going to be using this to do chart workor because at
the end of the day this is just like kind of a it's like a trading view integration here some people are weird
and they like doing their chart workor on here but then it's like okay I have to redo my chart settings and I don't
want it black not that I'm you know whatever but I like my charts looking clean and it's just way more preferable
for me to be on trading view with this clean setup rather than doing the chart
work on here and then also having to manage positions it's just it brings a lot in the mix here so even though the
markets the foreign exchange markets are closed right now I'll just do an example on crypto for you guys so again ideally
you guys aren't trading crypto it's a volatile market right now whatever there was just a whole bunch of news on bitcoin but down here is where we have
our positions okay and I'm going to get into this again later when we start explaining these pairs how they work why
they go up why they go down and then we're going to go into the strategy of how to actually Place trades and I'm going to go over a couple tools on how
you guys can use risk management because risk management is I mean there's a whole bunch of things to cover in this
video and we're just getting started but hopefully like trading is starting to make a little bit more sense to you guys now like hopefully we're we're bridging
that gap of I don't know anything about trading um to trading is bankroll to
okay I'm getting set up with trading and then by the end of this you guys are going to be like hey I know everything
there is to know about trading including strategy including risk management including how to control my headp space
my emotions whatever okay but I need to show you guys how to use this thing first how to actually Place trades so
right now this is like this is the lowest size that I can enter into a Bitcoin trade and bit Bitcoin and crypto
is a 24/7 market so the markets are open 247 I don't trade crypto I mean I do
like super long-term investing in it but that's besides the point I'm not actively trading it I trade indexes and
indexes are closed over the weekend but a brief example of how you guys would enter into a trade let's say this is my
allocated risk for the day I'll teach you guys again later in this video how you guys can actually actually calculate
risk using a risk siiz calculator but let's say I want to place a trade on
bitcoin and I want to place a buy cuz wow look at that price is price is going up I want to place a buy okay I confirm
that and then boom look at that oh my God oh my God oh my gosh we're up we're
up oh [ __ ] now we're down $45 oh [ __ ] yeah ramp this baby up give me more give
me more I want more
we're down $32 but sorry got a little bit excited
everybody um oh [ __ ] we might we might take profit okay sorry I I need to teach
you guys how to anyways now we're in one two three four whatever four freaking positions but we can see what's my
profit and loss in fake money again I'm down $38 $34 this is fluctuating what's
my current equity like in my account balance how much margin am I using so you're probably thinking like okay how
do I even know how much money I'm risking how much money am I going in with right A lot of people are like well
how much money do you go in with every trade and I'm going to get to that later but I just wanted to show and explain to
you guys how you guys can get in get in and get out of Trades okay so I that was a buy position right so how the [ __ ] do
we get out of this trade okay let me move my head down so you can see what this looks like I'm a little baby ant
now but you guys can see 1 2 3 4 buy positions on bitcoin we can see how much
each of them are up so there's a whole bunch of actions over here if I'm like literally printing bread I can share the
position to my friends and be like yeah trading's bankroll idiot you should watch tjr trades video then you guys can
edit the position you guys can do a partial close on the position you guys can fully close the position so let's
say I'm like okay this trade is looking scary I want to get out of this boom we hit close position we confirm Dam it we
just lost $24 so that like fully closed that one position I'm still down $25
floating on these other three positions here right why because we entered into buy positions here and price has just
gone down ever since man tjr sucks at trading right but there's a bunch of other actions that I want to teach you
guys about while we're on this platform and while we're on the topic of this so that was a full close what if we want to
just close a little bit of this position so the way that at least hero effects and trade Locker calculates position
size it does it on lots and I'll explain what these are and I'll explain how we can calculate how much we're going in
with per trade based on lot size and there's a really super easy calculator that I'm going to show you guys how to
use that makes your life way simpler okay but right now I entered in with 0.1 Lots on this so let's say I only
want to close half of this position what do I do I just crank this down to 0.05 lot lot and then what can I do I can
press close confirm 0.05 out of the one lots and now I have not only this one
fully closed position but I also have this position that I close for 0.5 lots
and then I still have that remaining position with 0.05 Lots still open okay
and then let's say I want to close the remainder of it 0.05 close confirm boom now I fully have
closed out of that remainder of the position now there's another thing that I need to teach you guys about that is
going to be very useful as time goes on in your trading career and hopefully it starts at the very beginning of your
trading career this is stop loss and take profits I'm going to teach you guys where to strategically put these based
on our strategy based so we are actually able to make money and make more money
when we win and make less money when we lose so we can end up being profitable Traders okay but first I need to just
show you guys how to place these on the on the platform so there's two different ways we can either click on this okay
and or sorry we want to edit this position sorry I'm used to it on the phone most of the time on the phone you can just click on the line so you're
going to go ahead and click edit position this tool shows up right here we have stoploss and take profit okay
these are probably some of the most useful tools in day trading ever okay
and this is kind of getting into how much money am I going to make on this trade how much money am I going in with
on this trade this is where these tools come in handy okay so again we're in this buy position our stop loss is where
we are exiting the trade okay so this is our draft stop loss this is another nice thing about herox in trade Locker see
how easy it is for me I can literally just drag it I can drag it and put it wherever so let's say our stop loss is
used to show when and where we want to get out of our trade and again I'm going
to explain to you guys how we can strategically place these so that we are
losing trades at the right time when our idea is invalidated and we are winning
and taking profits when our idea has been completed when our strategy has been completed okay and we want to get
out because again trading isn't just winwin win win win okay trading is like win loss winwin loss loss win win win
win loss loss win loss win loss okay it's always back and forth you're going to have winning days and you're going to
have losing days and I'm going to get into that within the psychology portion of this long ass video that you guys are
watching and again shout out to everybody has who's been sicking along for this but you guys are going to go go
through a period where you're like man I I keep losing or like oh I'd never want to lose no you have to be willing to
lose in trading not only to learn from your mistakes but also because no Trader
is 100% okay every single Trader misses shots misses trades okay and I'm going going to use a lot of basketball
analogies in this video but it's true Michael Jordan has missed a whole bunch of shots in his career but that doesn't stop him from being the goost the same
thing with trading we always want to take the shot but we don't know if it's going to go in or not all that we can do is we can train our skill on taking
those shots so that the probability of it going in is a lot higher than before so stop loss again I'm going to show you
guys how to strategically place this but this is cool there's a couple things here so not only when I drag my stop
loss it sets it to the price so see the price is 92 to 645 let's say I want to
put it lower it changes it to 91 96531 and then it also shows us the
percentage of our account balance that we're going to be losing so if we lose this trade we're going to beuse losing way less than 0.01% but we're going to
be losing 12 bucks okay from our $100,000 account size that little Timmy
really just wanted to be a billionaire with right so again if I move this up what are we going to be losing and this is kind of getting into like how much am
I putting in if we lose the trade here how how much did we go in with essentially $9 that's all you need to
know there's there's a whole bunch of these beginner day trading videos that are like well when you when you use this
this leverage and you have this account balance and then you enter in with this many lot sizes you're technically utilizing the leverage from The
Brokerage and then you're actually leveraging your current account balance by 500 or 50x depending on what leverage
that you use and then you're going to be entering in with this many contract size which correlates to this many lot sizes
and then like shut the [ __ ] up you nerd and just how much am I risking per trade
and I had to go through that so I'm telling you guys don't go through that [ __ ] just look at how much am I how much
am I going to lose damn it Timmy how much are you losing the family today
nine bucks bet your lunch money is on this trade so boom that's stop loss take
profit is where we want to win our trade so again let's say we want to win our trade up here how much money are we
going to make again we're risking $9 to make $8 it's pretty shitty trade ideally
we have a good risk reward and I'm going to talk about that again it's a long ass video but our take profit shows us what
price we want to close the trade app so again let's say we want to make $12 boom
or take profits up here okay and these are just drafted right now so once I click confirm it means okay I entered
into this trade if it hits my takeprofit if I win the trade if I make the shot I make 12 bucks 89 if I lose if I miss the
shot I lose $9.83 we confirm that and boom we got
the red line and the green lines scary ass lines right and then we can also see on the screen we have stop loss take
profit okay and then we can see where the current trade is at so right now this trade we're at a net negative
$11.35 and we can constantly track this but we know when this price gets hit we
are going to lose how much money not $9 if this price gets hit we're going to make $12 and whatever 80 something cool
so that's how you guys can enter into trades that's how you guys can exit trades that's how you guys Place take
profits that has that's how you guys Place stop losses and again later on in this video I'm going to show you guys
how we can strategically place take profits and stop losses so that we can make money day trade I'm going to
explain to you guys how you guys can place your stop loss strategically and
place your takeprofit strategically so you guys can have a good risk to reward
ratio so your rewards are higher than your risks consistently when you're taking trades W in the chat okay there's
one more thing actually that I want to show you guys on this program and on this platform on this broker okay so we're going to go ahead
and close this trade out we're going to close all of these trades out okay we're going to close position we ended up losing 55 bucks so that was on a buy
position okay again we want to buy low and sell High okay I I bought within 1 minute and then sold like whatever a
couple minutes later so obviously price isn't going to fluctuate that much and it's the weekend low volatility whatever
so that was a buy position what happens remember let's say the market crashes and how how do we how do we sell and
then how do we how do we enter into a sell position to actually make money because if we sell high and then Buy Low
we're still able to make money so it's the same situation right here click sell
confirm and that doesn't mean you're selling sing your previous buy positions no it means you're entering into a short
trade so there's a long long position means we think price is going to go up we want to buy the thing or we can enter
into a short position which means we think the thing's going to go down it's the same situation here we can close the
position completely we can partially close the position we can edit it and
when we're in short positions where's our stop loss it's going to be above where we entered into into the trade
right because how do we end up losing money on short positions price is going to come up and eventually our trade idea
will get invalidated if it keeps going higher and higher and we're eventually going to want to get out of this trade
at some point in time right so again in this case we're now risking pretty much
100 bucks on this stop loss okay so 0.1% of our account balance okay and if price
hits this we're going to lose money so now since we're in this short position since we're in this sell position we're
trying to sell high and then Buy Low and when we mean Buy Low it just means
hitting takeprofit and again I don't even want to go too deep into that because you guys genuinely don't need to
know that [ __ ] in order to make money in trading just like straight up you guys don't need to know that [ __ ] just know
short position sell position means we want price to go down and we lose trades
when price goes up and our stop- loss gets hit and we win trades when price moves down and our take profit gets hit
okay so our take profit is now low versus so on a short position our stop loss is above the entry and our
takeprofit is below the entry in a buy position in a long position our stoploss
is underneath the entry and our takeprofit is above the entry because when we're buying we want to exit when
price is at a higher price and when we're selling we want to exit when price is at a lower price cool so when we do
this we hit confirm and then boom our stop loss is right here our takeprofit is right here cool so that's how you
guys can enter into trades that's how you guys can enter into a long position that's how you guys can set a stoploss
that's how you guys can set a takeprofit that's how you guys get set up on trade Locker now what I want to do is swing
back around over to trading View and I want to talk to you guys just how to
read the charts okay just like on a bare basic fundamental level I want to explain those candlesticks you guys like
these candlesticks what they mean how it dictates and what it tells us about
price okay I also want to tell you guys like how do these foreign exchange pairs
even work like why is the Euro versus the US dollar going down and then going
up like we we kind of want to understand some of these things in order to understand like what are we even trading
okay it's one thing to just have a strategy and be like Candlestick go this way Candlestick go that way I enter
trade because I am tjr sex slave no you're not keep that in the video cuz I
want you guys to hear that but you're not not yet okay lock in Twin lock in
okay let me explain to you guys how these pairs work okay this is something
that you guys are going to see very frequently across all trading okay so these this is a Forex pair so it's the
Great British pound against the US dollar you guys see this in crypto all the time you ever wonder why crypto
pairs say like BTC slusd it's because it's Bitcoin against the US dollar you
ever wonder why gold is xauusd it's because it's gold against
the US dollar this is how we trade how we make money in the markets this is super quick and fast explanation because
I had to watch a [ __ ] British dude go over this [ __ ] for 50 minutes and I was literally ripping my hair out while I
was watching that beginner day trading course and this dude's like this is so important and turns out it's not that
important but when your family members are like hey little Timmy explain this Forex [ __ ] that you're doing and you got
to come up and you're like I don't know mama I just buy low and so high okay
they're going to be like get the [ __ ] off of that [ __ ] you're never going to be successful and that was essentially
what happened to me when I couldn't explain it so I'm going to explain this as simple as possible so you can explain
it to your families and then you're never going to need to use this [ __ ] again okay twom minute segment of me
explaining foreign exchange how this [ __ ] works so this is a Forex pair there's commodity pairs there's crypto Pairs and then there's also like indexes
and stuff and we'll get into that later so Forex pairs are literally just quoted pairs okay it's one currency against
another okay so in this case the base pair always comes first and the quote currency comes next okay so the base
currency Great British pound this essentially is showing how many US
dollars is equivalent to one single Great British pound okay so one single
Great British pound is equivalent to to $1.32
us got it that's literally all it is it's just it's a [ __ ] fraction okay
so I know this sounds confusing but the price of a pair is how much of the quote
currency quote currency it costs to buy one unit of the base currency so the
base currency is always just one okay and and crypto is a really good way of
understanding this so like if we go to the btcusd chart I'll literally pull that [ __ ] up
right now look btcusd we pull this up what is the price
at 93,471 so one Bitcoin is worth what
93,471 of these equals how many of these the
quote currency is how many of it and most of the time the quote currency is almost always going to be in USD unless
you're trading like weird Forex Pairs and by all means like you can trade the Forex pairs but this is just
understanding how the [ __ ] works so again Forex pairs it's one the base currency is always worth one and then
the quote currency is always what this one is equivalent to so let's say like
we wanted to do the pound against the Australian dollar it would be like GBP
SL a and then it would equal whatever one pound is equivalent to in Australian
dollars right so it's whatever the base currency is equivalent to in the quote currency and that's all you need to know
don't be thinking well yeah let me do my research on them [ __ ] pounds no bro don't do your research on them [ __ ]
pounds the only thing that you need to know is Big Ben British biscuits and beans okay bro don't be doing any more
research on them [ __ ] pounds the only research you need to be doing on the pounds is on the charts right here but that's essentially how price and why
price moves in the Foreign Exchange Market so same thing Euro USD okay so if we see this the euro
against the US dollar let's let's do a test here this is the price of Euro USD
right now and the market is closed so how many dollars is one worth let's wait
for the class how many dollars is one EUR worth God [ __ ] damn it Timmy okay
it's 13738 that's how many dollars one EUR is
worth okay now let's do it with gold because there's like Commodities and
[ __ ] let's do X auau because that's the sign for gold USD okay again this is the
pair gold let's click on it gold what is the price of gold
against the dollar $2,858 14 that's how much it costs I I
can't remember what like how much gold this is equivalent to I think it's like whatever a gram or something or an ounce
I don't know it does not matter we just need to understand this for when we explain to our families how this [ __ ] works okay so that's that's literally it
and then last but not least indexes which is what I'm mainly trade it's pretty much the same thing but indexes
doesn't have the slusd because indexes are just us indexes anyways so indexes
it's just the same exact thing so again if we want to buy one share of the S&P
500 how much would it costs $ 5,954 or how much is one share of the
S&P 500 worth5 95451 how much is one share of the
NASDAQ worth $2,884 okay that's all it is okay foreign exchange indexes crypto
Commodities we're learning y'all we're learning we're actually learning wa you guys are learning way faster than I had
to learn back then so like everybody if you guys haven't [ __ ] subscribed yet I don't know what you're doing get your
hands off of your dick click the Subscribe button and then go back to stroking your [ __ ] and let's keep this B
all moving okay now we know what to say to our parents when they ask us what we're doing we know how to explain it we
know how to enter into trades we know how to set up all of our [ __ ] now we can
get into the fun stuff let's get into strategy Bros let's get into how we can
actually understand where the [ __ ] this is going how we can make money on it let's get into this [ __ ] bro get excited
this is what you guys came here to learn you guys came to learn the strategy you guys came to learn about that bank roll
all right let's get it so before we can actually get into all the fun [ __ ] like
Buy Here Sell Here make a billion dollar whatever we need to understand what
these candlesticks even are what they mean what all these little numbers up here mean what these prices mean okay
what all these tools can do so that's what I'm going to break down now this is going to be within trading view I'm going to pull up a couple graphs to help
you guys understand some things and some Basics and then we're going to get into strateg then we're going to get into risk
management then we're going to get into psychology and everything else that you guys are going to need in order to start
working on the highest leverage skill literally in the world which is I mean it's so cool to say that I am a [ __ ]
with one of the highest leverage skills in the world and you retards can do it too so the first thing that we're going
to need to do is understanding these Japanese candlesticks so this is a super
good graph and understanding of these candlesticks we'll get into time frames
and how those represent these candlesticks a little bit better when we get back on the chart but these are our
literally only tools on the chart it's just it's just up and down candles so like how how are these going to help us
and how can we use these to our advantage here we go we're getting into the big [ __ ] now okay what is a
Candlestick it represents price movement within a certain amount of time and
everything that price did within that certain amount of time so each one of these candlesticks represents price
movement within a certain amount of time and the certain amount of time is dependent on what time frame you are on
on the chart and I'm going to explain that right after this but first I just want us to understand candlesticks in
general so this candle right here an up candle right here is called this filled
in part is called the body of the Candlestick these little lines right here these snail Trail lines are called
Wicks so again this is the body and then notice why they're called candlesticks because they have little Wicks it looks
like a Candlestick let me see what I'm saying the Shaded in part is called the body these little lines that go up and
down and I call them snail Trails for a reason are called Wicks now before we
even get into time frames or anything let's just explain this candle so let's say that we're on the daily time frame
and you don't need to understand what that is just yet but let's say that this one candle represents one day worth of
price movement so we see open we see low we see close we see high what do all
these things mean the open means okay the day started and this is where price
was when the day started when this Candlestick opened that was where this
right here is where price was at then at some point in time during and throughout
that day price moved down to this point in time so that's why I say it's called
a snail Trail okay because anywhere that price goes it leaves a trace it Le it's
going to leave a wick so the lowest point that price got to on this day was
right here how do we know that because of the wick the wick shows us that the highest point that price got to within
the day was all the way up here and then where did the price end at on the day so
we know that the day opened at this price right here and I know we don't have prices to the side but I'll show it
to you guys on the chart after we get through this and I know this is is confusing for you guys right now but you
guys will get the hang of it as we start going through this a little bit more and that's why I'm I'm being a little bit more serious now because this is when
we're getting into the big [ __ ] okay so right here is where the Candlestick opened and this is where this was the
price that the day opened at at some point in time throughout the day price
came down to as low as this point and that is marked out by this Wick at some
other point throughout the day price got all the way up here how do we know that
via this candlesticks Wick and then when the day ended price ended up coming back
down and then ending and closing the day right here
okay so why is this a bullish Candlestick because we opened at this price and we closed at a
higher price now a down Candlestick a bearish Candlestick is the exact opposite so now
let's say these are two consecutive daily candles so again this shows like 24 hours worth of price action now we
closed right here right on the previous day so when this day closes what happens
a new Candlestick opens that's why we'll see this bullish Candlestick close at
this price and then the next Candlestick open opens at the past candlestick's closing price more often than not okay
there's some exceptions but we won't talk about that for now so when this Candlestick closes this Candlestick opens it opens right here at some point
in time throughout throughout this day price got up here how do we know that
through the wick at some point in time price came all the way down here how do
we know that via the candle 6 Wick and then once all 24 hours has finished
price PR closed right here how do we know that it's a bearish and down
Candlestick because it opened at a higher Point than where it closed at I know this is a bit confusing but we're
going to take this slow and steady here I know this is this is super daunting but we're going to get through this and
you're going to be amazed at how far you come by the end of this video pause how far you come come on now you get what
I'm saying so each one of th this d stands for one day's worth of price
action so these are time frames this right now each Candlestick is
representative of one day worth of price movement again the price movement is
shown via this these candlesticks what happens if I move to the
4our time frame we now see price action and these candlesticks now show 4 hours
worth of price movement it shows more detail on the chart so when we were on the daily chart we're only seeing like
okay this is just one up candle this is 24 hours right this Candlestick right
here is 24 hours worth of price movement but when we go down to the 4H hour time
frame we can see those 24 hours split up into six candlesticks now why cuz 4 * 6
= 24 24 hours in a day you get what I'm saying so now we can see it's spread out a little bit more so now each one of
these candlesticks represents 4 hours of what price did so on this Candlestick
right here for example what did price do in those 4 hours where is the Open high low and close of this candles stick it
opened right here how do we know that well because price price went up right
so if it closed up then we know the open is right here it opened right here at some point in time during these 4 hours
price came down to this price right here
$887,000 at some point in time during that 4 hours price came to that price and then also during those 4 hours at
some point in time price came all the way up to 95,5 and then after those 4 hours were
said and done where did price close at $93,500
and now we can see on the right hand side see this little timer this is
showing how much time is left until this current Candlestick that is forming has
to close so this current Candlestick has only been opened for the past what is
that it's been like 34 minutes because there's 3 hours and 26 minutes remaining
on this and we can see that when this 4-Hour Candlestick closed where did the next one open where this 4our
Candlestick closed and we can see these Wicks these snail Trails form in real
time so right now for the past 35 minutes that this new candle has been opened where has price gone it shows us
every inch of where price has gone so far in the past 35 minutes how high has price
gone it's gone up to $94,200 it opened at
$93,500 and right now price is sitting at
$93,900 and it hasn't gone lower than its opening price I know this is
confusing but we're going to keep going we're going to slowly push you along here now what happens when I pull up the
1our time frame now those 4 hours are split up into four candlesticks so now
we're seeing even more detail so now instead of just seeing one Candlestick that represents 4 hours worth of price
action we are now seeing four candlesticks one let me remove these
drawings 1 2 3 4 so these four
candlesticks in this gray box here represent that 4-Hour Candlestick why because now we're on the 1H hour time
frame so now each one of these candlesticks shows one hour's worth of price action so during this hour what
did price do well during this hour it got to as low as $87,400
3 it opened from the previous hours close at
87,4 120 at at some point in time during those 60 Minutes during that hour price
got up to $ 91,92 and by the time that hour
ended price closed at
$1,288 and then what happens the next Candlestick opens and then it starts forming so if we look at most recent
price action this Candlestick has how long to close 23 minutes and 35 5 Seconds where
has it been in the past hour it's been up to $94,200
where did it open at $ 93,587
and how price has moved within every single minute we can even get down to the second charts 15 seconds 30 seconds
we can get down to the 5 minutes so now these candlesticks are showing five
minutes worth of price action okay so now we can see that that previous
bullish 1hour candle in boom a whole bunch of five minute candles so now we're seeing okay boom there was two up
candles then two Down Candles then one up candle then two down Down Candles then two up candles then one down candle
okay we're able to see every single detail of price movement using these
candlesticks and these candlesticks are super super beneficial it paints a picture and it tells us a story about
where price is going where price went and how we can and how we can expect
price to react and move in the future okay so that's that's candlesticks
explained again let's go back here we have the open we have the close we have
the high we have the low Let Me Show an example of a bearish Candlestick cuz we didn't show any bearish ones but a down
candle again where did price open on this down candle right here why do we know that price opened right here
because it it closed down right so we know if it closed down if it closed bearish the open is going to be above
the close so it opened at this price at
5 minutes it got up to the price of
$94,800 476 and then at some point in time during those 5 minutes price closed at
$93,500 now boom price action is is being demonstrated in 15-minute candles
and I know this is super overwhelming you're like what time frame do I look at what do I what am I even doing on this
what's the difference between one day worth of price action and one minute's worth of price action all of that is
going to be explained don't worry again my goal is to take you guys from literally knowing nothing about trading
to giving you guys the highest leverage skill in the world and this is just the start and I know this is overwhelming
right now if you guys need to go back and rewatch that like mini candlestick Candlestick explained portion you guys
can go ahead feel free okay but we are now going to be moving forward okay so that was like candlesticks and time
frames explained okay so again these time frames are essentially used to be able to show how long and what time
frame we want the candles to be split up in to see what price has done so again
if we want to see on a 15 minute so that means we want to see candlesticks that open in close and show
us price data from every 15 minutes we would click on the 15minute time frame
so again this shows us 15 minutes worth of price movement within each
Candlestick if we want to see just one day's worth of price movement within each Candlestick we would go to the
daily if we want to see just one week's worth of price Movement we would click on the weekly if we want to see one
month's worth of price movement and obviously as we move higher and higher
throughout the time frames the candles get bigger and bigger because right the the price fluctuation across higher time
frames is going to be a lot larger and then as we shrink down to maybe the 1
minute time frame the price fluctuations are a lot smaller because one minute can
only do so much in terms of price right so that's time frames and candlesticks
explain I don't want you guys to be feeling overwhelmed right now I know this is a whole bunch of information I
know when I was at your point in time I was super freaking overwhelmed with all of the information that was being thrown
at me just take it one bit at a time I hope you guys are taking notes during this because if you guys are that's
that's huge like the whole setting up the software and everything like that's easy that's just like a step byep but this is actually like digesting the
information we got to give our our body our brains time to digest this
information fully understand it and then once we fully understand it we can move on to the next concept so again I don't
want to rush you guys through this this is a really long video and you guys are going to if you guys just speedrun throughout all this whole video you
probably won't be able to digest all this information so like pause this video rewatch that Candlestick that time
frame explained okay understand it and then we can move on to the next subject
cool cool the next thing that we're going to get into is the day trading sessions so like I told you guys at the
start of this video if you guys are in the UK if you guys are in down under in Australia or if you guys are in the United States
if you guys are in Africa if you guys are in Egypt if you guys are in Asia whatever there is a time to trade for
every single one of you guys and that's one of the beauties of day trading is there are three sessions okay so I'm
going to pull up a chart there's going to be four sessions on there there's technically Australian session but it's
pretty much Asian session okay but there's three sessions there's Asian session or Asian and Australian session
but everyone just calls it Asian session London session and New York session and those three sessions essentially
encapsulate the full 24 hours of the market okay so from the day start to the
day end those three sessions encapsulate the entire 24 hours of a day New York
session is only open for how like a couple hours throughout the day London session is only open for a couple hours
throughout the day and Asian session is only open for for a couple hours throughout the day I'm going to explain the pros and cons to trading each
session what is going to be beneficial for you guys as Traders depending on your time zone and what is going to be
beneficial what pairs you guys might want to trade during each session and so
again like if you guys decide like okay for your time zone and the times that you are able to trade it's going to be
London session there's going to be certain pairs that move better that are going to give you guys better setups
during London session then let's say New York session if you guys say Okay I want to trade during New York session there
are going to be pairs indexes Commodities that just move better during New York session compared to other pairs
that might not move at all during New York session so I'm going to bring up a very useful calendar this is on baby
Pips it's essentially just shows us the overall session time zone so right now
it's a it's Sunday and we can see the markets are closing for the weekend but we can still just look so I set my time
zone to Eastern time that's how I have my charts set so my charts are set to
Eastern time down here I see everything in Eastern time we can see that down here uh let me point to it mink right
there okay you can see the date and then the time okay so where my hand is
hovering over right now boom it's 15 50 eastern time Sunday the 2nd of
March 2025 okay and then we can also like we can go back in time all the way back here so this was Friday February
28th like that's all the way down here this Candlestick was whatever Friday 28th February of 2025 at 3:35 a.m.
eastern time okay so let's go back here and let's see and understand the session
opens and closes so Asian session opens at 7
p.m. eastern time okay there is a small little Gap from when New York closes New
York closes at 5:00 p.m. eastern time and then Asian session opens at 700 p.m.
eastern time okay so you guys might as well write this down Asian session opens at 7:00 p.m. eastern time and then it
closes at 4: a.m. eastern time okay
London session opens at 300 a.m. eastern
time and it closes at 12 p.m. eastern
time New York session opens at 8 a.m.
eastern time and closes at 5 p.m.
eastern time now again each one of these sessions is going to have their own pros and cons so I'm going to get into their
pros and cons right now nice thing about website here is we can see okay like we can see the trading volume and
volatility on depending on what session you're going to be trading in now we can see when we get over here towards Asian
session it's pretty low volume in volatility so I don't want to tell you
guys what you can and can't do but I'm telling you Asian session price does not
move well at all and it takes forever to move and it's just because that session
there is little to no volume so I you typically say never trade during Asian
session that's just my rule of thumb never ever I don't care if you're trading an Asian pair like if you're
trading J the USD JPY Market does not move well during Asian session the only
two sessions that I would consider trading would be London session and New York session so London session opens at
300 a.m. eastern time so is that useful for me no cuz I'm not willing to wake up in the
middle of the night at 3:00 a.m. eastern time to trade London session okay London session we can see trading volume is
usually High during this during this time of day all throughout London session the trading volume is high so
that's awesome most of the time during London session the best pairs to trade
are literally All Foreign Exchange Pairs and commodities so that could be gold
that can be gbpusd that can be Euro USD that can even be some off pairs like GBP
JPY I used to love trading that I I actually used to trade London session back in the day like I was telling you
guys about I would trade GBP JPY so the pound against the Yen during London session because it worked for me in my
time zone so again you just have to find what what session open and what session what session you want to be trading in
but this is this is pretty much like setting your work hours so again if you're like oh I'm always busy during
this time time but tjr likes trading during during this time it's like no we're not doing that you get to set your
own hours within trading so figure out what session you are going to be trading and those are your work hours for this
okay so London session opens at 3:00 a.m. and then New York session opens at 8:00 a.m. so for me New York session is
obviously way more optimal than 8: a.m. is obviously way more optimal than 3:00 a.m. and luckily for me like during New
York session that's typically when there's the most amount of volume throughout the day which is which is
great for me cuz it's Boom the start of my morning I wake up and I start trading so again figure out what time zone
you're in what session is going to be more favorable for you to trade in so during New York session foreign exchange
markets they move well too I would like to say that during London session the
Forex Market moves a little bit better than New York session so if you say I want to trade New York session I would
recommend you trade indexes which is what I trade so that's going to trading the NASDAQ that's going to be trading
the S&P 500 or just really any of those us equities okay but if you guys to say
I want my trading hours to be during London session cool you guys should probably trade Commodities or Forex okay
so really any Forex pairs they move really well during London session and commodities something I want you guys to
keep in mind indexes if you guys want to trade indexes they do not move well at
all during London session so again if you want to trade us indexes because they are us indexes they only operate on
New York Market open so on like a Futures broker where you're only able to
trade us equities you won't be able to trade those pairs once the US market
closes on like a cfd broke I we're getting too deep into it but regardless if you are if you want to trade like the
S&P 500 in NASDAQ you can only trade it during New York session any other session first of all either your broker
won't let you trade it or it's just not a idea at all because there's no us money being put into the markets and the
only way for price to move in index is when US money is being put into the markets okay so figure out what session
is good for you and then from there we're going to hopefully explain like how can we read these charts on top of
that what charts do we want to be looking at because we don't want to be looking at a billion different charts
okay I know I have a super long list right here but I'm not trading every single one of these okay at all the only
the only ones that I'm trading are these two the S&P 500 and NASDAQ I'm only looking at two charts on a daily basis
and I'm able to make a bunch of money so what makes you think that you have to be looking at 30 different and trust me I
have been there in your situation before I've been in your situation and I've added like 30 different Forex pairs
Commodities cryptos and indexes and I've been looking at everyone at every single one of them at one time trust me do not
do that I'm trying to save you from mistakes that I made when I first started that's what this whole video is
about to save you guys from mistakes that I made when I first started and hopefully put you guys on the right track to being a profitable day trader
and I'm telling you right now make a new watch list and only make it with one one
single pair that you want to look at so if you say I want to trade during London session awesome trade during London
session and trade like the pound against the US dollar boom that's it just one
let's say you want to trade during New York session awesome trade NASDAQ only
boom that's your one okay and you're probably saying well then how come you look at two how come you look at two huh
well because I'm better at this [ __ ] than you and I've been doing it for seven years Timmy when you when you be
when you can get that type of experience then then you can start talking okay buddy I'm just kidding but like I'm I'm
serious at the same time all right so once we figured out what we want to trade again let let me go over some of
the Forex pairs for you guys really quick so just so you guys can get a good feel Euro USD super good starter pair it
moves rather slow but that's good at the start when you guys are just learning
this so Euro USD super good starter pair GBP USD pound against the US dollar
another good starter pair if you want to get a little bit frisky pound against the Yen it's a little bit it's a little
bit faster moving it's a little bit more vol volatile but it's also a good Forex pair so again this is if you're trading
London session another fun one is gold okay gold is a commodity and is
also a good pair to trade it's a little bit more volatile it moves quickly sometimes it's a little bit harder to
read and sometimes there's more fake outs than others um and again we're going to get into understanding the charts and why they move and the fake
outs and all of this and all of that as we go on in this video but I just want to give you guys some options for like certain pairs to look at so Euro USD is
good GBP USD is good GBP JPY we start getting a little bit faster a little bit more volatile gold we're definitely
getting faster we're definitely getting more volatile and then if you want to trade during New York session I would look at either the S&P 500 or NASDAQ
okay now that we've established what hours we're going to be trading and what we are going to be trading and now that
we know candlesticks now that we know time frames I think we can actually
start getting into understanding why and how the chart moves and how we're actually able to
capitalize and make money on these chart movements cool all right so now we're
going to be getting into the Bare Basics the absolute fundamentals when it comes
to understanding price action and price movements within the day trading markets
and just within the markets themselves so I know a lot of you guys when I was probably going over the candlesticks you
were like well how do I how am I supposed like yes this is a down candle this is a down candle this is an up
candle but how am I supposed to figure out where price is going to go don't worry we are going to get to that and
after all of these things that I teach you guys you guys will be very sufficient in understanding where price wants to go okay it will take some time
for you guys to get to that sufficiency level but just know I'm going to give you guys all the tools necessary in
order for you guys to succeed because that's just that's just the type of guy I am if I'm just being honest so the
first thing that we need to know how to identify is highs and lows within the
market so you're probably saying well I don't even know where to start on that well I'll keep it simple for you guys
okay a high is a two Candlestick pattern okay so you know those blue candles that are on my chart it's a move up a blue
candle and Then followed by a black candle and all you guys are going to do is you're going to look at both of those
two candles and you're going to find the tallest point or the highest Wick of the two candles and that's a high I know
you're probably saying tjr how is this going to be beneficial for me in the long run trust me it will because it's
one of the most important Concepts I know this seems super Elementary but it is one of the most important Concepts
that you are going to learn so understanding this now is going to benefit you huge later next a low it's
the exact opposite okay a move down followed by a move up okay and then you take the lowest point of those two
candles so again a high is a move up then a move down so a blue
candle then a Black Candle let's do a little test is a high a move up then a
move up no idiot it is not a high is a move
up then a move down is a low a move down then a move down you'd be surprised I
know you're probably saying well yeah obviously it's not you would be surprised at you would be surprised
that's all I'm going to say it's a move down then a move up in the lowest point of those two candles cool let's go into
the chart and work on identifying them so where are the highs oh yeah see now it gets a little
bit scarier now that we're looking at all of this mumbo jumbo gets a little bit scarier so what we're going to do is
we're literally just going to walk through this and we're just going to label highs and lows what's a low a move
down then a move up so where do we have lows well this is a move down then this is a move up cool where's the lowest
point of those two candles right here boom that's a low where's a high well
it's a move up then a move down right move up move down awesome the highest point of those two candles this is a
high next one boom move up then a move down highest point of those two candles
this is also a high move down then move up this is a low I have a question for
you guys this Candlestick Wick right here what is this this is a tricky
one this Candlestick Wick right here what is it if you said hi I'm literally going to
gargle your ball sack with my tongue swirling around your pubic hair and then
Chomp down on it that is not a high a high is a move up then a move down so
where is the high move up then a move down the highest point of those two candles move down then move up the lowest point of those two candles boom
are we getting the feel are we getting into
okay are we getting into the flow of things now are we or are we not was that just me move down then move up boom low
move up then move down boom High okay now let me show you an exam a better example of what's not a high and what's
not a low because again some people they be they be on that dumb [ __ ] right here
we have a low right where is it okay um
you Timmy uh where is the low Timmy well it's at the lowest point of
those candles s Quicks a clap it up for Timmy he got it right
Timmy you little [ __ ] don't make me spank you on the
bottom of your ass with a full stack of books that is not a [ __ ] low where is
the low this is black than black that's not an interracial that's not an
interracial marriage we need a black and a blue or a black and a white maybe
light skin type [ __ ] okay we need black than blue black than blue lowest point
of those two candles where is the low boom this is the low it's not this why
one black two black three black four black that's like we're not [ __ ] with
all of that okay we need black then blue that's the low okay let's show a good example of
the opposite and we actually have it right here where is the high right
here is it this because it's the highest point no why cuz move down then a move down
it's not a [ __ ] high move up then a move down this is a
high we good good now that we understand highs and lows guys you guys are doing
good you guys are doing good you guys just have like another five more hours and then two years of struggling until
you turn I'm kidding I'm kidding but low key though you guys do have some more work to put in because it's not as
simple as just highs and lows because again let me ask you where do you think this chart is going I can tell you right now where
this chart is going but I can promise you you right now with the information that I've given you so far you ain't got
[ __ ] so we keep plowing through and I'm going to keep plowing through for you guys next thing that we need to
understand is Trends how does the market even move okay so put let's put a pin in
identifying highs and lows in the market also also also pause pause pause pause pause before we get into this go on your
own on trading view Mark out five highs and five lows just to re like cuz again
there's one thing of you just watching this video and then there's another thing of you guys taking action I need you guys consistently taking action with
this video in order for you guys to fully digest this because if you guys just sit and watch and you're like in your popcor man the tjr guys kind of
[ __ ] funny I think I'm going to learn how to no bro no it's not going to work
okay so what I need you guys to do go ahead Mark out five highs and five lows
done awesome now we can get into how does the market move the market moves in
three different ways it goes up it goes down and then it goes
sideways so we need to be able to identify when the market is going up
when the market is going down and be able to identify when the Market's going sideways so this is going to be
introducing Trends okay and Market structure so to keep things simple when
the market goes up does it just go up like this forever no even Bitcoin
doesn't even do that okay when the market goes down does it just go down like this and down forever no even meme
coins don't do that okay and then also consolidation or sideways movement so
when price moves up how does it move up get very familiar
with this terminology it moves up in higher highs and higher lows so remember
we're taking the pin out of the highs and lows now and we're plopping it back in here highs and lows okay so how do we
identify it okay when the Market's moving up it moves in what higher highs
and higher lows so if we have a high right here and then a low right here and we're in an uptrend and Market's moving
up what is market going to do it's going to do what make a higher high than the
previous high that it made and it's going to make a higher low than the previous low that it made and then it's
going to make a higher high than the previous high that it made and then it's going to make a higher low than the previous low that I made and then it's
just going to keep going like this cool so before we show downtrends let's show
examples of this we've had pretty pretty brutal price action the past couple
weeks and months so I want to find a good example of this th this is kind of like the start of a good example
here okay where's our low right here where's our high right here okay high
low price pushes past this High then does what we have a higher high and then
we have a higher low and then what happens we have a higher high move up then it move down then we have a higher
low move down then it move up then we have a higher high move up then it move down then we have a higher low move down
then it move up all the way until boom structure gets broken on this move down
so uptrends how do they move in higher highs and higher lows Flow State Flow
State Baby Boom so when we're making higher highs and higher lows what are we expecting the market to do to continue
the trend the trend is your friend get very familiar with that as well the trend is your friend in this market
because if the market is trending up what are you probably going to want to do press buy if the Market's trending down what are you going to probably want
to do press sell but before you guys log into your brokerage and put $1,000 billion dollar on what I just taught you
we need to learn way more because it's a lot more than just higher highs and higher lows and blah blah blah and we're
going to be billionaires okay it's a lot more than that now downtrend what is it it's the
exact opposite so when the market is going down what is it doing it's making lower
highs and lower lows so it follows that same Flow State
movement and follows that same Trend where we have a high a low lower high
lower low lower high lower low lower high lower low lower high lower low lower high lower low and boom that's how
a downtrend is formed plain and simple let's go ahead and let's identify it on the market
because on the S&P 500 it's kind of like an up only type of index so it's kind of
hard to find downtrends there's like mini downtrends here this is fine ready
this mini downtrend within the uptrend is fine we have a high right here
right we have a low we have a high right here we have a low we have a high right
here and then we have a low high low lower high lower low lower high
lower low before the trend reverses and I'm going to teach you guys how to one
be able to identify these reversals two be able to trade these reversals and
three be ahead of the game so that you guys don't get caught up and lose trades on these reversals when you're trying to
trade within the trend got it got it but for the time being I want you guys to
pause this video go to trading view boom go ahead and Mark out just go and
identify and it doesn't matter what time frame okay you can be on the weekly the daily whatever that's that's something
else that you guys need to know and understand every single thing that I'm teaching you guys on here is applicable
to every single time frame so that's the cool thing about the market this is on the weekly time frame right each one of
these candles is a week's worth of price action not not only are there high are there highs lows lower highs and lower
lows on the weekly time frame but when we go down to the 5 minute time frame is this structure the same for identifying
down Trends and uptrends yes it's the exact same Let's uh let's find an example here this is a good example
look high low lower
high lower low lower high lower
low lower high lower low
lower high lower low lower low until what the
trend reverses so that's the cool thing about these Trends and that's the cool thing about all of these tools and strategies
that I'm going to show you guys in this video they are applicable to every single time frame these Trends happen on
every single time frame the way that the market moves it moves the same on every single time frame so once you know how
to trade you that's why I'm telling you trading is literally the highest leverage skill in the world bro because
once you learn how to day trade you are able to predict price in Market movements on every scale on the weekly
level on the monthly level you'll know where price is going to go within the next 5 minutes like it's so powerful the
skill of day trading and that's why I'm so passionate about this [ __ ] because I know what it did for my life and I know what it can do for yours and that's why
I'm making this this video for you guys so continuing we know what to look for when the Market's moving up we now know
what to look for when the Market's moving down what happens when the Market's moving sideways that's called
consolidation and typically the market will just be looking like
this okay it won't have any sort of trend it won't have any sort of direction there's no higher highs
there's no higher lows it's just it's it's making AB like random highs lows whatever and it's just moving sideways
so perfect example of that is literally what we're in right now on the daily
time frame so if we just look at this most of the time I'm I I show and demonstrate consolidation just by a big
rectangle why because this isn't a trending Market this Market is moving
sideways so we can see we have a high that a low then a lower high then a higher low then a lower high but then a
lower low but then a low lower high and then a higher low and then a higher high
then a higher low but oh wait now that's a lower low and then a higher low and then a higher high and then a
lower low see it doesn't this is not a trending Market this is a sideways
Market but luckily there are ways to trade this and I'm going to teach you guys how to trade it again now that you
guys know how to identify consolidation go ahead and do that and again just like moving up and moving down this is a
applicable on every single time frame so this is like literally the past couple months on this because each Candlestick
represents a day in the market right now cuz I'm on the daily time frame bro like this has been we have been in this
little consolidation range for the past couple months but we can even scale we
can scale down to lower time frames and we can find consolidation there as well so like look right here look at this the
market is just just freaking moving sideways high low blah blah blah blah blah blah it just looks disgusting until
the market finally breaks out and then what happens it starts trending down makes a high then a low lower high lower
low lower high lower low okay so we need to be able to identify not only
downtrends and uptrends but also consolidation cool once we have that we
are ready to move on to the next subject so now that we know how to identify
Trends now that we know how to ident highs and lows we're on to our very first concept and our very first
Confluence that is going to be extremely beneficial for you guys in trading which
is called Break of structure so I'm going to break down every single one so
first of all I know I'm using big words but at the end of the day I like I told you guys before I'm like actually on the
Spectrum so I'm just like a nerd with the trading [ __ ] so I prefer to call things their correct names but
Confluence is pretty much just like uh it's like a reasoning to get into a
trade or like it's a reasoning for why price moves so most of the time you say
like oh yeah what were your confluences to enter into a trade like what were the
reasons for why you entered into a trade and you say like oh there was a break of structure and there was an imbalance of
price here and price came in and it filled it blah blah blah blah blah bank roll so we are going to cover break of
structure first this is a Confluence okay that is very useful for us and it
is kind of one of the first steps of understanding price movement so break of
structure you often see people um abbreviated as just B okay boss man Dow
all right so what is break of structure so you guys just learned about Trends right you guys know what a trend is
break of structure is essentially when the structure the trend breaks okay so
when the current Trend gets dis
respected that's all it is when the current Trend gets disrespected now how do we identify it I'm going to put this
as simple as possible break structure is one of the easiest confluences to understand so hopefully you guys get it
and also guys get [ __ ] excited this is like our first like real deal real Spiel like get [ __ ] excited this is
our first thing that we can actually like start [ __ ] applying and getting
like my eyes are lightened up I feel like I'm on [ __ ] Molly and cocaine right now and I'm just
like I'm just so fired up to teach you guys this [ __ ] so please be as fired up
as me and take some [ __ ] notes break of structure it's when the trend current Trend gets disrespected okay if we're in
an uptrend higher highs and higher lows how would we hypothetically break
this trend how would we disrespect this trend well we would just quite simply stop making higher highs and higher lows
right so in order for us to no longer have higher highs and higher lows what
has to happen we have to make a lower
low right and a potential lower high now a break of structure to the
downside which which is what I just marked out is when we are in an uptrend
and the most recent low make sure you take notes of this because this is important as much as I love messing
around okay I want you guys to be successful a break of structure to the downtrend the to the downside is when we
are in an uptrend and the most recent low emphasis on most recent one the most
recent low that was created gets closed underneath by a a candle okay and we are
going to show examples of this but a break of structure to the downside is when we are in an uptrend currently
making higher highs and higher lows and we get a candle closure so in our case
and on my chart it would have to be a big girthy wide
Black Candle you thought candle that closes
underneath the low okay and that's how we can identify a break of structure to the downside now break of structure to
the upside what is it well it's when we are in a
downtrend so making lower lows and lower highs now how do we break a
downtrend simple we make a higher high instead of another
lower high Boom the trend is broken off of this how do we officially break
structure on this when we get a big wide long long
lanky in my case blue Candlestick closure over what the most recent high
so how do we break structure to the upside when we are in a downtrend we get
a candle closure above the most recent High okay the most recent high that was
made within the trend we get a candle closure above it that's how we identify break of
structure so now that you guys know how to identify break of structure at least on my Picasso drawings and on lines
let's actually get into the difficult part which is actually identifying it on
the chart so there are two things that I want you guys to pay attention to when we go onto the chart the first thing
that you guys need to do is Boom immediately identify the current Trend that we are in so you got we already
taught you guys how to do that right we're just looking for higher highs and higher lows okay cool once we do that
what are we going to be looking for we're going to be looking for breaks of structure okay so see when that current
Trend that we are in gets disrespected okay so those are the two things that I want you guys to look out for when we
get into this okay tell me what you see yeah it's a lot hard it's a lot
harder when we when we pull up the charts and we got Candlestick Wicks everywhere and we don't know what what
price is doing don't worry I'm going to break down pretty much all of this for you okay so this this is actually a
really good example that we have right here we'll just go ahead and start here we'll we'll start within this area okay
we have a low then we have a high move up then a move down the highest point of those two
candles following that what happens this candle closes Above This High cool so
prior to this we were in a downtrend why high low lower high lower low lower high
lower low okay and then after that lower high and lower low got made what did we do do we broke structure to the upside
how because we closed above the most recent high that
was made in the downtrend I know it's confusing but stay with me now now what trend are we in
after we break structure on this candle because we closed above the most recent High something I want you something I
want you guys to also notice look so we have a high right here right and then a new high gets formed right here does
this High get broken above when this comes up and gets me no so what do we have to classify as the new high now
right here whenever we're waiting for a break of structure to the upside we're just constantly monitoring highs
whenever we're waiting for a break of structure to the downside what are we doing we're just constantly monitoring the new lows that get made so in this
case we're looking for a break of structure to the upside why cuz we're in a current downtrend and how do we look
and wait for a break of structure to the upside we just monitor the most recent highs that get made so this was the most
recent high that got made and then boom we break structure so now we're in an uptrend and we can see that why we have
a high this low is a higher low compared to this one and then boom we go up and
we make a higher high now this is where it gets tricky and this is where it's going
to get very confusing for some of you guys see this Candlestick right here we have a low right here and a low
right here but this low this move down then it move up goes underneath both of the these
lows is this a break of structure no and I know that is very hard for your brain
to contemplate right now because you're like wait but there was a high and then
this went underneath two lows it made a lower low yes you're right it did make a lower low but how do we identify a break
of structure and in this case right now that we're in an uptrend we're looking
for breaks of structure to the downside what do we need we need this low because this is the most recent low we actually
don't care about this one this is the most recent low what do we need to happen to this low we need this to be a
full Candlestick we need this to be a full Candlestick we need a candle closure so look see the difference
between this High what did this candle do to it it closed above it the candle
close is above this High did this candle right here break structure no because it
was only a wick above the high but this candle it closed above so when we look
at this right here this Candlestick where's the most recent low what is our current Trend we're currently in an
uptrend for us to break structure to the downside we would need this candle closure to be underneath this low so for
that reason we are still in an uptrend and price respects that and goes
and makes a new higher high and then look what happens again now this is the
most recent low even though we technically did make a lower low we are still in an uptrend
because we haven't broken structure yet and look what price does again price goes down do we get a closure underneath
the most recent low within the we are still in an uptrend because we haven't broken structure to the downside yet no
we do not break structure to the downside and then where does price go it rips up
I know that was very confusing but I needed to show you guys those examples of no breaks of structure so again if
we're in an uptrend and this is our most recent low and we see a Candlestick Wick go underneath this most recent low is
that a break of structure no it is not okay it is not a break of structure to
the downside the only time that it's a break of structure to the downside is when we get a candle closure underneath
the most recent low so let's Show an example of breaking structure to the downside now within this we are in in an
uptrend why and how do we know that well it's just it's [ __ ] going up okay I mean I I could Mark out the highs and
lows if we needed to look move up then then move down high move down then move
up low higher high higher low higher high can't cool this is actually another good example of this actually look we
can see this Candlestick boom it actually goes underneath this low but it doesn't close underneath it and then
what happens price maintains that uptrend it actually goes up and to create a higher high so now
where's the most recent low that we're looking for in this uptrend to get broken this is the most recent low where
do we break structure I want you pause this video look at it where do we end up breaking structure to the downside what
Candlestick we break structure to the downside on this candle right here why because look at the candle close this
candle closes underneath the most recent low that was made within an uptrend so
now what are we in after we get a candle closure underneath this low we are in a Down Trend so now we have a high now we
have a lower low now we have a lower high now we are literally forming as we speak a lower low now that you guys know
how to identify brakes of structure this isn't the magic pill this is not going to turn you into a profitable Trader but
now that we know how to identify Trends and now that we know how to identify highs and lows and now that we know how
to identify breakes of structure we are in an insanely good spot and get [ __ ] ready because
in yeah literally in like the next couple minutes you guys are going to learn [ __ ] that's going to blow your [ __ ] mind and honestly it blew my
mind when I learned about it or when I discovered it on the charts and I am going to help you guys blow your or I'm
going to try and blow you guys I I want to blow you guys and blow your guys'
minds so let's let's go do do that okay see I see I did that I did that I
blew you got get it I told you I was going okay all right let's learn about liquidity this is by far the most
important concept oh like this is the goat of
Concepts the greatest of all time of Concepts and then the concept following this this is like Michael Jordan versus
LeBron debate liquidity is LeBron and then fair value gaps and imbalances is like Michael Jordan why cuz liquidity is
better than fair value gaps and imbalances LeBron is better than Jordan but before we get all the old heads
riled up MJ was better let me just teach you guys how to trade this [ __ ] first okay so what even is
liquidity liquidity is pending orders or okay we'll do this for the retards just
resting orders above highs and Below lows
that's all it is that's all liquidity is liquidity is resting orders above highs
and Below lows and you're probably thinking hey I know what a highend low is that's right Timmy you do know what a
highend low is so you know where liquidity is liquidity is above highs
and Below lows consistently without a doubt every single time liquidity is
above highs and Below lows so if there's a high in the market what is there above it liquidity if there's a low in the
Market what's there below it liquidity more importantly resting orders now when
I explain liquidity I like to explain it like this we as retail Traders so first of
all if you guys don't know how the market moves okay the market moves off of just off of market makers not us so
we are retail Traders we are making the tiniest smallest
transactions compared to funds and the people that are actually moving the market okay so that keep that in mind
okay so the people that are moving the market the market moves based off of algorithms and algorithms in order for
them to fulfill orders they need orders to go in the other other direction okay so just like how I explained in that
whatever that little Ecom class example of buying the share of Apple stock right
if I want to buy a share of the S&P 500 or if I want to buy a share of the
NASDAQ somebody has has to be willing to sell it to me this is equally true at
scale so let's say I want to buy 1 billion worth of S&P 500 or $1 billion
do worth of S&P shares let's say I want to buy a billion dollars worth of NASDAQ
shares okay somebody has to be willing to sell that to me so again how did how
do these transactions take place well I know this is kind of going to be counteractive to what I just taught you
about uptrends and downtrends but just bear with me for now just like how I taught you guys that
when we're in an uptrend we make higher highs and higher lows okay market makers know that in a downtrend we make lower
lows and lower highs so when we move P when we're in a downtrend and we move past a low what's what's going to be
expected we're expected to go lower right and then what's going to happen when we push past this low well people
are going to sell people are going going to get into short positions underneath this low
right okay and Market's going to move lower right cuz that's what they think is going to happen in an uptrend when we
push past a high in an uptrend what do people often do they often place a buy
position why because they think hey the Market's going to move higher why CU we're in an uptrend when Market moves
past the high what do people do above the high they press buy there's buy orders above these highs okay cuz what
are they expecting price to do they're expecting price to go higher now this is true to an extent
until the market wants to change directions how can the market have the ability to change directions what gives
it the ability to change directions through liquidity and what is liquidity resting orders above highs and lows
something else that we need to understand about uptrends and downtrends is when we're in an
uptrend making higher highs and higher lows we have to understand when we're making this move down even though we're
in an uptrend not every single person in the market sees this as an uptrend I know this might get confusing but you
got to bear with me not everybody sees this as an uptrend so they see this move down and what are some people doing they
are selling so they're entering into short positions here and where are they putting their
stop loss they're putting their stop loss above these highs so when they enter into a sell position right here
they essentially are committing to buying back their position at a higher
price up here if price pushes up there so there are pending buy orders up here
not only that but when this High gets pushed above the people who thought it was an uptrend in the first place are
pressing by why because they say hey we're in an uptrend I think price is going to go higher so what lies above
these highs here a massive amount of buy orders now same thing in a downtrend in
a downtrend what lies underneath these lows well for the people that think and
know that it's a downtrend when this low gets pushed past what are they going to be doing they're going to be pressing sell okay they're going to be pressing
sell because they're like hey we're in a downtrend price is going to go lower on top of that the people who saw this mini
retracement up the people who saw this move up to make the lower high they
might have thought hey we're going to go into an uptrend so if they bought on this move up where is their stop- loss going to be where are they going to have
to sell their shares at a lower price to lose their trade underneath these lows
so not only do we have people who are buying in the market down here getting stopped out and having to sell their by
positions at a lower price underneath these lows but we also have people who are trying to sell the market once these lows get pushed underneath so we have a
ton of sell orders underneath lows within the market so we have a ton of buy orders above highs and we have a ton
of sell orders underneath lows now let's think back to that example that I was
just telling you guys about what happens when a big player or the algorithm needs to fill a massive amount of orders to
change the current direction or to change the trend of the current market it needs orders to fill where is it
going to find those orders above highs and Below lows
because there are buy orders above highs and there sell orders below lows so you're probably saying okay so when we
go underneath a low what do we do do we press sell no or I mean it's not that
simple it's not just we push past a low and you press a button if it were that easy everybody would be rich this is
just a step in the right direction but when we push underneath lows what does the market have the opportunity emphasis
on the word opportunity because it doesn't have to it can continue this
downtrend right but every time it moves underneath one of these lows it does have the opportunity to what sweep this
liquidity use these sell orders to do what fill their massive amount of buy
orders to change the direction of the market and that is what liquidity is and that is what a liquidity sweep is a
liquidity sweep which is by far the most important Confluence that I'm going to teach you is when the market manipulates
a high or a low within the current Trend to fill their massive amounts of orders
to change the direction of the trend to cause a reversal so in
this case we're in an uptrend we move past a high the people that thought it was an uptrend what are they doing
they're pressing by the people who thought it was going to go into a downtrend who had a sell position in
what happens to them they get stopped out they have to buy back their sell positions at a higher price causing them to lose money but then what does that
give the market the ability to do fill their sell positions to cause price to actually go down does that make sense
now you're probably saying well how do I identify how do I know what high and what low is important and which one is
which one price is going to reverse off of don't worry I'm going to teach you that but the first thing that I want you
to do is to think that I'm not a crazy lunatic and show you guys this on the charts I'll show you a really awesome
and hilarious liquidity sweep or at least it's funny to me remember that
super scary horrible sickness that was going around in the
year 2020 was it really a super
dangerous super scary illness or was it
just a liquidity sweep and a catalyst to be able to fill
all the rich people's orders to make them 10 times richer than
they already are what did price do and keep in mind
there's liquidity on every single time frame there are highs and lows on every single time frame these confluences show
up on every single time frame what did price do during the two
months that everybody was freaking out it pushed underneath one two and three
lows and what did that give the market makers and the richest people in the world the opportunity to
do to press buy and to fill their orders and to cause the market to go
up so not only can we see that on a high time frame with a news Catalyst but we
can also see it on low time frames actually we see it on a daily basis look
at this right here this was an example that I just showed you guys for examples of not breaks some structure we see big
move down we push underneath one low we push underneath two lows and then following
that what does Market do boom it rips up we can see this on even lower time
frames market right here it's in a downtrend imagine if you are at this
current price you see a chart that looks like this I know it seems easy in hindsight but it is difficult when you
get into the actual markets we see price that looks like this just realistically
any normal person looking at this chart is probably like wow this looks like [ __ ] it's going to go lower it's exactly
what they want you to think let's watch this candle form boom
we come down we take out this low we get everybody to press sell we we get
everybody who bought on this mini move up to exit their buy positions and then what does that give the market makers
and the rich people the opportunity to do make a [ __ ] ton of
money and causes the market to go up this happens on the one minute time frame it happens on the 15-minute time
frame it happens on the 5 minute time frame it happens on every single time time frame liquidity sweeps are what
move the market liquidity and imbalances is what moves the market so this is a
very very important concept that I want to teach you guys I mean matter of fact we actually saw a huge High time frame
liquidity sweep today look at this High time frame low another high time frame low what did we just do today we just
swept out this low swept out this low and we swept out this
low and now look at what price is doing this is the magic pill this is
what is going to help you turn profitable but I'm telling you right now it is not as easy as just saying oh look
there's a high I'm going to press sell why because we have to think back to those Trends right we already showed
that the market moves in higher highs and higher lows so if we press sell at every single high and press buy at every
at after every single low that gets pushed past we are going to be losing and we're going to be a horrible Trader
so now that we know how F first thing that I want you guys to do pause this video and go onto your trading View and
just just just identify a time where Market has moved underneath a low and
then changed Direction Just identify five liquidity sweeps in each Direction so at least you guys know that I'm not
crazy and you guys can see and identify these things so you guys know that it's real but it's not as easy as just
pressing buy when we move underneath a low and pressing sell when we move above a high we're going to get way more in
depth about understanding what Highs are important what lows are important and what times to be looking for these highs
and lows are important okay but the first thing that we just need to do is just understand that hey this thing
works and it's real and it's how the market fills its orders to move in the direction that it wants to go call me
crazy but I just showed you multiple examples I just showed you a global worldwide example of how the US
manipulated not only you guys but literally literally every single person in the entire world to be fearful to
literally fill their orders that should piss you off that they used
you you are getting used we are no longer going to be the ones that are getting used by the market and by the
people that are rich and wealthy we are going to start trading with them we are
going to start trading like them we are going to start trading with them and eventually we will become one of them
hopefully not as rude and as much of a dick but again these liquidity sweeps
they are what move the market I mean again we can see literally on a weekly time frame boom huge leg down what do we
do we take out this low then following that what does the market do it moves up these it's not a lie it is real and it
is how the market moves so now that we know how to identify liquidity I want I
want to put a pin in this and now but before we put it put like how to put all
of these things together I know your brain is like okay I know what a trend is I know what a high and low is like
when can I actually understand where the Market's going to go when can I understand this Tyler or tjr sorry whoa
legal name dropped I know everybody already knows my name but when can I figure out where the Market's going to go just be patient I want to teach you
guys every single Confluence first so I taught you break of structure I just taught you liquidity sweeps I'm now
going to teach you guys about imbalances and fair value gaps the again liquidity and imbalances make the market move the
way that it does okay after I teach you guys all of these confluences and I feel confident that you guys know these
confluences and what they are and how they move the market from there that's
when we're going to put it all together because I I find that's best like if you guys are able to just like pause this
video and be like bet I just want to know and identify liquidity sweeps and where they are in the market go [ __ ] it
like I have a I have homework for you literally go on every single time frame that you have up here and try and find
try and find a liquidity sweep on every single time frame where price moves above a high and then changes Direction
and break structure to the downside that's what I want you guys to do find five examples of when price moved above
a high just to sweep liquidity and then caused a break of structure to the downside I also want you guys to find
five examples of when price moved underneath a low and then cause the break of structure to the upside to
change direction because not only does that reinforce that liquidity sweeps are real but that also helps on both
confluences why be and how are liquidity sweeps confirmed well when we push underneath a low and then we break
structure to the upside it's it's like well yeah orders were filled we just broke structure we just changed the
[ __ ] Trend how else would that happen with orders being filled with liquidity being
filled so now that we understand that let's get into imbalances it's pretty
much like the opposite of liquidity almost but it's it's it's in the
greatest of all time in terms of confluences and is huge for us to
understand where we want the market to go on a daily basis and again I know you're like how are we going to put this
all together trusted me you guys have trusted me this far it's been like two hours already I we're thugging it out
I'm making this video for you guys I'm makeing like this is literally everything that you guys need to know this is [ __ ] everything I'm telling
you guys right now this is literally [ __ ] every single thing that you guys need to know and Y are chilling after
this one [ __ ] video this one video is literally teaching you a to [ __ ] Z
how to become a profitable Trader I'm doing it all bro I'm doing it all and I'm trying my best all right so let's
get into fair value gaps now imbalances or and or fair value
gaps they're the same thing often abbreviated as fbgs
what are they I know you can't use the definition in the whatever the name in
the definition but I often I often do this it's
imbalanced price action that needs to
be balanced out the a
retrace so imbalances SL fair value gaps I know it I'm using the whatever the def
the word the word in the definition but deal with it I'm not a grammar person
it's imbalance price action that needs to be balanced out via a retrace first of all if you guys don't know what a
retrace is when we're in an uptrend it's the down move so the down
move is called the retrace so this is called the retrace why do we call it a retrace because when the overall trend
is up it's just retracing so it can go higher re retracing the up move so that
price can go higher okay same thing to the downside okay so
we have boom retrace up move down retrace move
down retrace extension retrace extension these moves up are retraces within a
downtrend moves up are retraces in a downtrend moves down our retraces in an
uptrend okay so all that imbalances and for value gaps are a price
range that is imbalanced that needs to be balanced out via a retrace so I try
not to classify things as Candlestick patterns because I'm sure a lot of you
guys have probably gone through like some other day Traders thing and they're talking about Head and Shoulders pattern
they're talking about double top double bottom Candlestick pattern I look I'm
not going to say it's [ __ ] I will say that when I tried to
trade that way it never [ __ ] worked but maybe I was the issue back
then but coincidentally when I started trading like this I was no longer the
issue and it started working take that for what you will so I'm not a believer in Candlestick patterns however I am a
believer in reading and identifying balance imbalance price action where
orders are lacking on the chart where orders are resting on the chart to cause price to move the way that it does and
that's exactly what an imbalance is and luckily for us we can use Candlestick
patterns to demonstrate these so let's just jump straight into this [ __ ] what does an imbalance look like what does a
fair value Gap look like it's a three Candlestick pattern this is one
Candlestick this is the second candlestick and this is the third
Candlestick let me make this an up candle instead of a down candle there we
go okay so this is an imbalance this is imbalance price action
from this Candlestick Wick to this Candlestick Wick why is this imbalanced
price action why is this price action right here imbalanced I'll tell you so
the first Candlestick that was made we opened right here at some point in time we had sell orders that pushed us
down here at some point in time we had buy orders that pushed us up up here but Al we also had sell orders that had to
come in to move price down and then have price close right here this following Candlestick it's a big bullish
Candlestick huge move up right we had the highest point that it got to was up here the lowest point that it got to was
down here sell orders up here ended up causing price to push down the third candlestick opened right here at some
point in time we had buy orders move it all the way up here sell orders moved it down causing it to close here we also at
some point in time had sell orders push price down here so throughout all of
this I know that was a lot sound like sounded like a lot but in this price range what are we lacking we're lacking
sell orders why because if we think about the first Candlestick at some point in time we had
buy orders that push price up and then sell orders move price down from here so boom sell orders stopped here and then
we see boom huge bullish Candlestick then the next candle okay we
see price open at some point in time price had sell orders that push price down to here but the sell orders stopped
here so where is there a lack of sell orders right
here within this price range and this is how we identify bullish Fair value gaps
from the top of the first candlesticks Wick to the bottom of the third
candlesticks Wick that is how we identify a bullish fair value Gap should have made this green so there's a lack
of sell orders within here when or if price comes down and
retraces into this imbalanced price action it's imbalanced because there's a
lack of sell orders so when we get the sell orders to come down to balance it
out and when we fill this Gap and we get buy orders within here what is likely
going to happen because there's a lack of sell orders once we hit it with some buy orders in this in this price range
where there's a lack of sell orders what is go what is that going to cause price to do go higher this is a bullish fair
value Gap now let me show you an example of what a bullish fair value Gap is not
well what happens if this candlestick's Wick goes all the way down here and this
Candlestick Wick goes up here what happens if the Candlestick Wicks overlap well then there's no imbalance there's
no imbalance price action there's no imbalance price action why because sell orders were were here at some point in
time price moved up here and sell orders had to push price down and also on this third Candlestick at some point in time
sell orders had to push price down to here so these Wicks overlap so there's no bullish for value Gap within here
this on the other hand there's a lack of sell orders this is a bullish fair value Gap now what's a bearish fair value Gap
well also something that I want you guys to keep in mind there's two things that I want you guys to keep in mind the only
Candlestick color that matters is the middle Candlestick so
obviously if it's a bullish fair value Gap this Candlestick is going to be green or in my case blue if it's a
bearish fair value Gap this C the Candlestick color is going going to be red or in my case black the first and
the third Candlestick color doesn't matter this Candlestick could be a bearish Candlestick as long as these
Candlestick Wicks don't overlap there is imbalanced price another thing that I want you guys to know about fair value
gaps is they are just like penises no I am not joking a fair value Gap is the
equivalent to a penis a male follicle a male limb let me explain side does not matter
we as gay Traders as day Traders we do not care about the size all that we care
about is what lies within we care about the personality we yearn to learn more
to balance out that imbalance regardless of the size no matter what size it is we
want it we need it I need it okay plain and [ __ ] simple a fair value Gap
is a dick literally as simple as that so a bearish fair value Gap how do we find it
from the first candle's bottom Wick to the third candle's top Wick again it
doesn't matter if this Candlestick is
black blue Chinese or Indian we don't see color on
the first in the third Candlestick the middle Candlestick we're racist as [ __ ]
if it's black it's bearish or at least on my that was if it's if it's red then
it's bearish on your guys's chart if it's black it's bearish on my chart
there's no racial correlation there I love everybody from everywhere it's just
for the example purposes it helps the VIS it helps us visualize this a lot better the penis correlation the race
correlation it all it's all for your own benefit you guess what you're going to remember this now I I'm telling you this
I promise you you won't remember this [ __ ] when old [ __ ] gezer is like yeah
when you get the imbalance price action and then the Enigma goes up and wants to
balance out the fractal and the Enigma for the power of three
and no we don't give a [ __ ] about that we're car we're we're talking about blacks we're talking about whites we're
talking about Indians we're talking about Asians we're talking about Dick we're talking about gay we're talking
about everything why cuz it what it's what keeps us locked in it's what it's
how we remember it I write I hope you write down in your notes a fair value Gap is like a dick female day Traders
don't get mad at me don't get mad at me girls you know it's true period period a
fair value Gap just like that dick period that size doesn't matter it's just what lies in It's Just What Lies
Beneath the sheets baby it's just what can do it's just what can make that [ __ ] work it's just the motion of the ocean
it don't matter about that dick baby it just matter about what's inside you
period if you got that dog I'm going to take it R that's enough for now okay so a bears
for Value Gap is from the first candlestick's Wick down to the third
candlesticks Wick up so what is there a lack of within here there's a lack of
buy orders when price moves up into that fair value Gap where there's a lack of
buy orders and it balances out price action and it fills its sell orders
within there since there's a lack of buy orders what is that going to cause price to do go down and continue the trend a
fair value Gap in an imbalance is is a Confluence that I like to call a continuation
Confluence write that down a fair value Gap is a continuation Confluence okay
fair value gaps are continuation confluences why because they continue the trend that we are currently in break
of structure okay let me just go ahead and label these really quick I might as well make make this reversal confluences
liquidity sweeps confirmation confluence
uences break of structures and inverse for Value gaps we haven't got to inverse for Value gaps yet don't worry about it
but I just want this so you guys can screenshot it or write it down in your notes continuation
confluences fair value gaps order blocks we're getting to those next breaker blocks and equilibrium and another
confirmation Confluence is an smt and we'll get to all of these we're going to talk about every single one of these
okay so we already learned about liquidity sweeps we just learned about confirmation we just learned about fair
value gaps now why are liquidity sweeps reversal confluences because they are the signs of a of a trend reversal why
are break of structures confirmation confluences because they
confirm the break of structure they confirm the break of the trend they
confirm the reversal and you're going to see when I give you guys this strategy we go from Reversal confluence to
confirmation Confluence to continuation Confluence to execution we go from
liquidity sweep to break of structure or inverse fair value Gap or smt down to
fair value Gap order Block Breaker block or equilibrium to execution because it's
all three steps of a full Trend reversal we need a sign of reversal via
liquidity sweep we need confirmation of the trend break and the new trend shift
via break of structure or inverse value Gap or smt which we're get yet to get to and then we need proof and actual like
belief in this new change of structure and in this new break of trend that we just had by showing what continuation of
the trend via what fair value gaps so just take a take a picture of that for now we'll get back to that but now I
want you want to show you guys fair value gaps on charts just like liquidity sweeps fair value gaps are on every
single time frame and you can this is something about fair value gaps going back to dicks okay fair value gaps are
just like dicks you don't want to [ __ ] every single dick okay there's only some dicks that you want same thing with
liquidity sweeps okay you only want to liquidate some people and you want to leave some people unliquidated you don't
know what's going on in their junk the junk in their trunk okay we don't want to get down in there we don't know the
past we don't know their history it's the same thing with fair value gaps and liquidity sweeps okay and I'm going to show and tell you guys how to identify
the correct fair value gaps how do to I identify the right liquidity sweep but right now I just want you guys to
understand that these things work so I just want we're going to show examples of this on the chart and then from there
we'll put a pin in it just like we did with liquidity sweeps something else that I want you guys to keep in mind
fair value gaps are nothing without context so I can go out here and I can
Mark out all these fair value gaps but they don't mean [ __ ] without the right context of price so I can Mark out this
is a bearish fair value Gap right here why didn't price move down off of it well because we don't have the right
context to be using this right now we we had another bearish for Value Gap right here price actually did fill this one
and then it did move down off of it okay it's all about the context I can pull I
can show a whole bunch of f value gaps that like this bearish F value Gap right here okay first let's let's do this a
little bit slower because I know I'm speedr running through these but okay first candlesticks bearish for Value Gap
how do we mark it out from the bottom of the first candlesticks Wick to the top of the third candlesticks Wick what is
it a three Candlestick pattern one two 3 we just look for the gaps the easiest way to identify it is like oh look
there's three candlesticks and there's a gap between them that must be a fair value Gap look at this right here look
there's three candlesticks and there's a gap between them that must be what a fair value Gap and then you can see and
just look at the Candlestick color in between them boom it's a bullish fair value Gap three candlesticks with a gap
between between them oh that's a bullish for Value Gap three candlesticks with a gap
between them oh that's a bearish for Value Gap very easy to identify there's
a fair value Gap here there's a fair value Gap here there's fair value gaps
all over the place now what I want you guys to do pause the video go to your chart right now identify five bearish
for Value gaps identify five bullish fair value gaps what I want to show you guys on top of this lesson is show you
guys how they get respected because fair value gaps can get disrespected and they
can also get respected and this is kind of going to leave lead us into inverse fair value gaps right after this
explanation so this is a good one right H right here we have a bearish
for Value Gap why is it a bearish for Value Gap because the third candle is a move down okay we have one candle two
candle three candle we take the bottom Wick of the first candle to the top Wick of the
third candle and we just boom we draw a little box on it this fair value Gap it
got filled right but then we got a Candlestick closure above
it so what did we do to this fair value Gap right here we disrespected it this is no this fair value Gap is no longer
valid okay for a fair value Gap to get respected we have to fill it without get
getting a Candlestick closure above it and then get a candlestick closure down
it doesn't matter if the Candlestick closes down within the fair value Gap just matters that we come in fill it and
then the next Candlestick or it doesn't have to be the direct next candles stick it could be one candle up two candle up
three candle up as long as it doesn't close above the fair value Gap and as long as we get a candle down
out of it boom that's that's it being respected as long as it's in the right context price should move down same
thing on a bullish fair value Gap let me find a an example this is this is a good
example of a current one that's about to get disrespected as long as price Clos underneath it but
look we have a bullish for Value Gap right here how do I know that first Wick
I mean just look right there's a gap between the three candles first Wick's
or the first candle's top Wick the third candle's bottom Wick this is the gap
price right now currently disrespecting it we'll know for a fact if it gets disres expected once this candle closes
in 8 minutes again just because price is down here like this right now doesn't mean that okay this this for Value Gap
is said and done no it can leave it as long as price closes in here if it
leaves a long ass Wick like this that's okay I'm fine with that okay and I'll
show you an example of that of a fair value Gap getting filled with a long ass Wick and it's still being valid this is
a good example of this uh fair value Gap being respected perfectly so what is this this is a bearish fair value
Gap and again we get one candle Clos two candle close three like whatever there's
a whole bunch of candle closures within this but as long as the candle doesn't close above the fair value Gap it's
still valid and then boom what do we get we get a bearish candle closure confirming that sell orders have been
filled and then price ends up moving down also I just want to point something out to you guys look at
this so you can see the magic start to work liquidity
sweep we were current we were within an uptrend break of structure to the
downside on this Black Candle followed by fair value Gap getting filled price
moves down anyways now that we know let me show you one or two more examples of
this being valid so we have look right here another bearish for Value Gap price
comes up into the bearish for Value Gap it accumulates for a little bit and then boom goes down let's try and find some
more examples here again what I want you guys to remember is forfeit value gaps
when you guys start trading these you guys are going to think these are magic pill and you guys are going to start marking them out and then you guys go go
and start pressing buy and sell every time a bearish or bullish fair value Gap gets filled well guess what that's how you lose you lose by trading these
confluences just by themselves you win by trading them together in a good strategical manner that is optimal for
efficient price for efficient price movement and I'm going to teach you guys that we just have to get through all the
I know like day trading is a hard skill so we have to get through these steps first this is a good example of bears
for valy Gap getting respected with the wick that actually went above it so right here notice how the wick goes
above this bearish for Value Gap right it goes above this bearish for Value Gap
however what does it do it doesn't clo or I mean assuming that the next hour
isn't just this huge candle that ends up turning up but assuming that this candle closes like this this bearish fair value
Gap is valid it it hasn't been disrespected because it's just like a wi it's just a wick so just like break of
structure if it's a wick we don't care okay but a candle closure above a fair value Gap we do care now that leads me
into what inverse fair value gaps are an inverse fair value Gap is literally just
a fair value Gap getting disrespected so as I mentioned before a inverse fair
value Gap is a confirmation Confluence so an inverse for Value Gap I know we're
just jumping straight into this but hey man you guys you guys wanted to learn how to trade this is how you guys going are going to learn this [ __ ] an inverse
for Value Gap is a fair value Gap that gets disrespected
within current order flow that shows a
change of trend oops let me change
this order flow is just Trend you guys don't have to worry about that an inverse for Value Gap is a fair value
Gap that gets disrespected within the current Trend that in turn shows a new
change of trend so let's say we're in a downtrend and you're going to start to see how we can start piecing these
things together to identify hey when is a low or a high valid for a liquidity
sweep let's say we're in a downtrend and we're retracing into a fair value Gap and then we go lower and you're like
holy [ __ ] draw liquidity psych we keep going lower we fill another fair value Gap and then we
keep going lower and then we keep going lower and then we have another fair value Gap but then what's that we end up
disrespecting it when we disrespect a fair value gap or we'll we'll show it in
both directions but when we disrespect a bearish fair value Gap
within a downtrend it's just like a break of structure in that in order for fair
value gaps to be valid when they get filled it's showing that price is going to continue in that Trend Direction well
when a fair value Gap gets disrespected what is that likely a sign
of that the trend is no longer going to continue in that direction so we can
treat an inverse fair value Gap simp similar to a break of structure similar
to showing a change in Trend and you'll see here on this fake chart that I drew
we come down we sweep out this low and then how do we know that this low was an
actual liquidity sweep ah Boogie's coming to say hi how do we know I know
Daddy's been working I know buddy I know how do we know that this is a valid low
yeah sorry how do we know that this is a got Carri right there how do we know
that this is a valid low that swept out these sell orders that actually filled buy orders well with two different ways
or three different ways really but the two ways that we know now are either a break of structure so how do we identify
break of structure well this high would have to get closed above but sometimes we're lucky enough where there's fair
value gaps and these fair value gaps get disrespected before the high gets closed above and it tells us even earlier that
these Trends are going to change direction start to piece this together I don't want you guys to think that you're
Shadow money wi wizard gang we love casting spells just yet and you know how
to do this don't get off this video there's still a lot more to learn but we're almost there so within an uptrend
we're making higher highs and higher lows we're retracing into a fair value Gap and we go higher we retrace into a
fair value Gap and then we go higher and then we have a fair value Gap right here and then uhoh this fair value Gap gets
disrespected we close underneath it there was a whole bunch of buy orders right here how do we know that these buy
orders got filled or these buy orders got or these sell orders sorry got transacted with these buy orders because
we see a fair value Gap get get disrespected and then boom the trend
changes so let's show this on the chart now and again a inverse fair value Gap is literally just a fair value Gap that
gets disrespected and again just like with all of our other confluences this
happens on what every single time frame there's inverse for Value gaps on the weekly time frame monthly time frame
daily time frame 4 hour time frame 1 hour time frame 5 minute time frame every single time frame that's the awesome thing about the way that I trade
this is a good example here okay so let's look at this price is in a
downtrend I'm we're not going to put all the pieces together just yet I just want to show you guys this price is in a
downtrend what do we have right here a bearish for Value
Gap it gets disrespected by price closing above it we actually also get a
break of structure because this was the most recent high in the downtrend so we not only get a break of structure to the upside but we also get an Inver a
bearish inverse for or a bullish inverse for Value Gap sorry closure above it price ends up
moving higher okay let me show another example TR find a bearish example this
is a good example ah now there's a breaking structure before it I want to find a good example of uh when there
isn't a break of structure before it this is a good example of there not being a break of structure before it so
this is when that that an inverse for Value Gap would come in handy where's the most recent high in this downtrend
it's right here or at least until this High gets made but look instead of us having to wait and potentially enter on
this candle closure Above This high or above this high we can look to enter on this Candlestick
closure why because there's an inverse for Value Gap right here there's a bearish fair value Gap that doesn't get
respected this candle that closed above the fair value Gap it got
disrespected but again same thing applies there's millions of inverse fair value gaps that happen across every
single time frame but not every single one of them is going to cause a reversal not every single break of structure is
going to cause a r IAL every single one of these confluences cannot be used on their own they have to be with context
okay they have to be used with context and without context they are [ __ ]
nothing okay so now let me let me try and find another example again these are
on every single time frame so let me go to like the hourly this is a good example right here this actually puts
everything together look at this sweep of liquidity a sweep of a high followed
by what a bullish fair value Gap that gets
disrespected price ends up going down good example
here pushes past a high bullish fair value Gap that if
price wanted to continue this uptrend should have held we get a candle closure underneath it price moves lower okay so
now that we know how to identify fair value gaps and inverse fair value gaps I want to go ahead and talk about all of
the other confluences that I use on a daily basis so that's going to be breaker blocks that's going to be order
blocks that's going to be equilibrium and then that's going to be smt divergences and then once we have all of
that I know it sounds like a lot and that's okay you guys can keep coming back to this video you guys can keep
pausing it making sure F first thing do your homework okay get five examples of
an inverse for Value Gap in both directions show a fair value Gap getting disrespected I know we're moving quick
here but welcome to the game trading moves quick and your life is moving
quick as well so you might as well learn the skill of day trading because it's the highest lever skill in the [ __ ] world and hopefully by the end of all
this I can show you that once we start putting things together and you're like wow holy [ __ ] this dude's a wizard Shadow money wizard gang billion
trillion dollar baby okay um but with that being said we're going to get into
all these other confluence is and then we're going to be able to put every single thing together in a systematic
way of trading so that you guys can make billions okay so with that being said
let's get into let's get into order blocks and breaker blocks now all right let's talk about order blocks let's talk
about breaker blocks and let's talk about [ __ ] order [ __ ] and break your
[ __ ] order blocks what are they order blocks what the [ __ ] are these
things oh man what are order blocks order blocks
I'm lit I'm edging you guys you guys are like just spit it out spit it out tell me what an order block is I'm I'm on day
two of learning how to day trade and you just don't even say it anymore all you want to do is just talk about penises
and dicks and it's not even funny anymore I've been sitting through three hours of this and guess what Timmy it's
my video I I get to decide what we're talking about ever been to jerk mate
finals I don't think you have so sit your ass down bronze Buster that's right
I'm an emerald edger you haven't made it to my rank yet pipe down before I pipe
you order coocks what are they the leg
up Third Leg type [ __ ] type [ __ ] the leg up or leg down prior to the liquidity
sweep and that's all it is the leg up or leg down prior to the liquidity sweep or
it's really that caused the liquidity
sweep so how do we identify a liquidity Sweep with boom when we move above a
high and then get a break of structure or an inverse for Value Gap following that we just talked about this so a
bullish order block is the move move up prior to the liquidity sweep or sorry a
bearish order block sorry Down syndrome a bearish order block is the move up
prior to the liquid or sorry the move up that causes the liquidity
sweep prior to the break of structure okay so this move up right here is considered
our order block why is it considered an order block well let's just think back to liquidity sweeps we know there's a
whole bunch of buy orders that are above this these highs right so when price moves up to fill these buy orders what
is happening on this move up a whole bunch of sell orders are given the ability to be filled because as we're
moving up and as we're sweeping out these buy orders and filling these buy orders what are the market makers doing
they're filling the sell orders to cause price to go down so what do we know about this price range from the start of
the move up to the top of the move up there is a a whole bunch of potential and there's a whole bunch of probability
to be able to fill sell orders so if price comes back into this price range
where there was a a lot of probability and a lot of potential for price to be able to fill sell orders and we see a
move down following that showing that sell orders have been filled what is likely going to happen price is likely going to move down off of that okay now
again on the contrary let's show the bullish we're in a
downtrend we get a sweep of liquidity and then
boom okay we get a sweep of liquidity there's a whole bunch of sell
orders that are able to get filled underneath this low this move down gives
price the opportunity to what fill byy orders to cause price to change
direction we get a break of structure to the upside confirming that we have changeed Direction now this price range
this move down which essentially filled all those buy
orders we have a high probability and possibility of filling buy orders within this price range so when price comes
back down within this price range or if price comes back down within this price range and then we see buy orders out of
it what is price likely going to do it's likely going to continue higher
now how can we identify them on the chart another thing that I wanted to mention order blocks can either be one
candle or or they can be two candles they can be three candles as long as it's consecutive so if we have oh look
pretty sweet breaking structure this is our order block right if it's three consecutive up candles we take it from
the bottom of the first candle to the top of the last candle as long as it's three consecutive up candles this can
also be considered one single up candle it can literally just be one single up candle with a wick that goes above this High okay same thing to the downside it
can be two consecutive Down Candles it can be three consecutive down candles but what it can't be is like an up
candle and then a down candle and then two up candles that go up to sweep out
this High these two aren't the order block these two are because these two are the two up candles that cause the
sweep got it cool let's go into identifying them now and again just like
with every single other one of our confluences this means nothing without
context let me try and find a good example here okay this is a good example so right here okay we have a liquidity sweep
right liquidity sweep and again this is a liquidity sweep to the downside and then we see a break of structure to the
upside so we're looking for a bullish order block right we break structure on this candle closure right here we also
have an inverse Gap right here so liquidity sweep inverse for Value Gap and break for structure to the upside
cool sweep of these lows inverse for Value Gap break of structure to the upside where is the Candlestick that
moves down that causes the liquidity sweep prior to the break of structure to the upside this Candlestick right
here this is our order block okay this move down is what caused
the liquidity sweep and it's the move down that caused the liquidity sweep prior to the breaking structure of the upside so we see once we get this break
for structure to the upside price moves down back into this order block we see boom buy ORD is filled after that price
ends up moving higher okay let me find a bearish example okay this is a good
example right here we get a liquidity sweep to the upside how do we know that it's a liquidity sweep because we end up
getting a break structure to the downside right here we also have an inverse bullish for Value Gap right here
we we get the inverse for Value Gap and the break of structure at the same time
with this Candlestick closure okay we have one two three four five up candles
this move up is what caused the liquidity sweep so we encapsulate all of those candles this is our order Block
it's the price range where those sell orders were able to get filled hey boogie you came back for more pets okay
so price moved up it swept out these highs one two 3 four five consecutive up
candles prior to the break of structure of the downside this is our order block we mark it out price comes up fills in
this order block we see a down candle and then boom price ends up going down a lot again these mean and are nothing
without context so so don't just start marking out order blocks and taking trades off of them okay it needs to be
systematic it needs to be strategic and it needs to be within the right time at the right place okay and if we do that
incorrectly then we're [ __ ] okay but this is a good example
of order blocks okay I want you guys to find five examples of bullish order blocks I want you guys to find five
examples of bearish order blocks and then come back to me all right
I also want to show you guys an example of or what an order block is that gets disrespected so again an order block can
be valid as long as this is different than fair value gaps so it's similar to
fair value gaps and that candlesticks can close within here but it's different with fair value gaps where price cannot
have a wick above the order block so I mean obviously if a Candlestick closes
above the order block not only is that a break of structure back to the upside
but it's disrespecting the order block obviously but also we can't have a wick
above the order block there is an exception to this which is called an smt Divergence but in
that case we are not taking the trade off of an order block we're taking a trade off the smt Divergence and that's
a whole different story and we will get into that story later after order blocks
breaker blocks and equilibrium okay so go ahead and find five examples of order blocks on your chart for me okay pause
this video go find five examples of order blocks okay so once you guys have done that we're going to go ahead and
talk about breaker blocks which are essentially the same thing as an order block except just a little bit different
so breaker [ __ ] breaker [ __ ] whatever breaker blocks are the move up or down
again to the break of structure to the up
slash downside in Trend shift okay so breaker blocks are
they move up or move down prior to the break of structure to the up SL downside in Trend shift so it's literally the
same definition as an order block except it's the opposite I guess if that makes sense not really but look say with me
now in an uptrend okay let's say we have an uptrend right here right an order
block a bearish order block right is the move up that causes the liquidity sweep
that causes the orders to be filled now the opposite is a breaker
block a bearish breaker block is the move
down so again most of the time it's relatively the same price range for the
most part sometimes it's different but for the most part It's relatively the same price range but it's the moved down
that and the the reasoning behind this is It's a failed retrace so typically
these retraces are what gives price the fuel and Trends the fuel to push higher
and keep extending higher and higher and higher so the reason that this is a a good tool for us is because it's a
failed retrace so it's saying it caused price to move down or sorry the the breaker block didn't cause price to move
down but price moved down this retraced down and then we have had buy orders
that pushed us up but to take out this draw on liquidity we didn't have enough
buy orders to keep price pushing to keep price to continue in the trend and then
price broke structure so order blocks are where there's a significant where we were able to fill a significant amount
of sell orders in the past this is similar to fair value gaps where there's
a lack of buy orders here so order blocks are where there was a significant amount of sell orders that were able to
get filled within that price range this is there is a lack of buy orders that
were filled because why like we weren't able to fill enough buy orders to continue the trend higher So within this
price range because there's a lack of buy orders similar to fair value gaps if we get in here and we F fill sell orders
price is going to move down again with the right context and confluences now same thing to the upside okay so if
we're in a downtrend that was horrible
if we're in a downtrend this order block right here right this moved down it gave
us the ability to fill a significant amount of buy orders right so this price
range is where we were able to fill a significant amount of buy orders the opposite is this breaker block this move
up this retrace that failed to fill the amount of sell orders required for us to
get a full extension and continue this downtrend so what is there within here a
lack of sell orders so if price comes back and retraces within this
Confluence and gives us buy orders out of it and how do we see buy orders just byy a candle up by the way I don't think
I mentioned that we are likely going to see price continue up now let's Show an example of this on
the chart this okay so look right here okay we get a break structure to the downside right we don't have to go
through all the steps but we get a breaking structure to the downside let's practice both order blocks and breaker blocks so where's our order block or
quar block these two up candles right the up candles that cause a liquidity sweep where's our breaker block the down
candle the retrace prior or the Down Candles because it can be
multiple prior to price breaking structure and prior to the liquidity sweep so in this case price doesn't hit
the order block but what does it fill it fills the breaker block then following that price ends up moving down okay we
actually just formed or after these 11 minutes go by will actually form a good example of this again on both of these
so look we get a break of structure to the upside we already broke structure to the upside we haven't officially
confirmed this yet once this candle closes bullish then it'll show that we're respecting these but we have the
candles down that caused the liquidity sweep this is what our order block and then we have the up candle prior to the
liquidity sweep and prior to the break of structure that is our breaker block okay let's uh show another example
of both of these hopefully you guys are getting good at this again I want you guys to be
able to see these and notice these like the back of your [ __ ] hand this is a good example of only a breaker block
getting filled we get a break structure to the upside right here okay where is our order Block it's this down candle
right here where is our breaker Block it's this up candle prior to the liquidity sweep which one gets filled
the breaker blocks get there's a move down into the breaker block it gets filled bullish out a bit boom price ends
up moving higher now again I know I keep saying this but these confluences really do mean nothing without context so again
if you guys see a breaker block or an order block get formed I don't want you guys just blindly going in and taking
trades off of these things because you will end up losing but we are so close
we're literally two confluences away from having everything that we need to know in order to take profitable trades
at the right time on the right time frames and to be able to read price action for what it is okay we are so
[ __ ] close we are almost there all right so [ __ ] close let's do our homework of marking out five order
blocks in each Direction and let's do our homework of marking out five breaker blocks in each Direction and now let's
get into equilibrium which is another one of our continuation confluences okay so order block and breaker blocks as you
guessed are continuation confluences okay these are continuation confluences
why because we get a liquidity sweep first we get a break of structure a change of Direction a change of the
current Trend that we're in and then we see price continue the trend off of
these confluences off of these patterns okay so next is going to be
equilibrium equilibrium is going to be another continuation Confluence and then
smt is a confirmation Confluence and then from there we will be able to put
all of this [ __ ] together and teach you guys how how to take profitable trades
and I'm super excited to do that so let's get into equilibrium all right sorry I started the next lesson without
even pressing record equilibrium what is it why do we need it why do we want it
why is it amazing for us equilibrium essentially marks the 50% mark from
highs down to lows or lows up to highs within retracements and listen I
could explain the complete brand riac really awesome really long and thought
out explanation for why equilibrium is beneficial but I honestly there's just
no real reason to do that so as long as you just can see this [ __ ] work in
action that's all that we need to know so equilibrium is the 50% Mark just know
that price more often than not if it's retracing off this 50% Mark or if it's
reac off this 50% mark from swing low up to swing high or from swing High down to
swing low depending on what trend we're in and again I'm going to show you guys how to mark this out on the chart obviously but that's all that you guys
got to know it equilibrium is the 50% mark from the most recent high slash
low to the most recent low again and that's depending on
what trend we're in so let's draw this out again this is a continuation Confluence so if we're in an
uptrend how do we Mark out equilibrium first of all what tool do we use to Mark out equ equilibrium with this is one of
the first times that we're actually going to be using one of these tools one of the first and only times that we're
going to be using one of these tools actually okay the tool that I like to use for this is the Gan boox okay so in
an uptrend when we're trying to find bullish equilibrium we use the Gan ball box and
I'll go ahead you guys can go ahead and copy my settings
here y get those settings nice and good buddy okay so when we're drawing
equilibrium bullish equilibrium so let's say we're in an uptrend or we're trying to find a continuation Confluence to the
upside say there's no for Value gaps there's no order blocks there's no breaker blocks Last Resort equilibrium
cool we draw it from the low the most recent low up to the most recent high and if price comes down
underneath this 50% mark because this pretty much measures the extension and
and gives us the 50% Mark of the extension showing us where discounted
price is and where premium price is more often than not or it's just known that
if price moves into a discount let's just think about this if your favorite Cheeto puff or I know some of
you [ __ ] idiots are going to be like I don't like Cheeto puffs like okay fine what does everybody like every Everybody
Needs water let's just do [ __ ] water well no because there's cheaper water God [ __ ] damn it everybody likes ice
cream and if I hear somebody talking about I don't like ice cream in the comments [ __ ] you okay this is the
example that I'm using imagine you like ice cream and imagine your favorite ice
cream that you buy is worth
$23,170 1857 are you going to buy it duh CZ
you're fat as [ __ ] you're gonna buy that [ __ ] right there it's the same thing
with the markets if we're in an uptrend and when we get retraces into discounted
prices so this all this does is it helps us measure from the start of an extension to the top of an extension to
measure out where do we start getting discounted prices within this uptrend underneath this 50% Mark the 50% Mark is
equilibrium because it's in between premium and a discount okay this this line is showing the premium and the
discount okay so if we push into a discounted price range and market makers
F buy orders because that's optim right it's a cheap price what's going to happen price is probably going to move
higher that's all it is it's all it is probably one of the easiest confluences to learn people still somehow find a way
to [ __ ] it up and I'm going to show you ways that people [ __ ] it up in a downtrend we take it from the high down
to the low so that actually won't hit equilibrium let me redraw
this okay equilibrium we take it from the most recent High down to the most recent
low and now when when we're looking for sells right we want price to be at a
premium and we want to sell it at a discount right so when price pushes up
into a premium and we say I ain't paying for that [ __ ] ice cream
and I know damn well nobody else is paying for that [ __ ] ice cream I'm going to short this [ __ ] the market makers they say [ __ ] that [ __ ] we're
tanking it boom they enter into sell positions at a discounted price we see
that price is likely going to move down now how do you not Mark out
equilibrium I know it sounds stupid because I just explained it to you but retards will do some [ __ ] like this take
it from this random ass High down to this random Mass low is this the most recent high that was made no is this the
most recent low that was made no what else will retards do well we're in a downtrend and they'll say okay well you
take it from the most recent high and low that was made well this was a high that was made and this was the low that
was made but what why isn't it getting hit well idiot you draw it from this high down to
this low okay not from this high back in time down to this low once we make a new low
right here then we can take it from this high down to this low how do we identify
highs and lows within the market with a move up and then a move down how do we
identify a low within the market a move down then a move up okay pretty simple
let's go onto the chart and let's look at this [ __ ] let's literally look at the
most recent thing that we saw break your structure to the upside what are we now in uptrend motion
let's look for a continuation Confluence oh my God would you look at that it hit equilibrium I'm going to jack off and
then nut all over the screen and it's all so sticky tjr please wipe it off of me and then do it again oh it's in my
eyes I can't see please leave your Gan box on I want to see it most recent low
what's a low move down then move up up to the most recent High move up then move
down okay equilibrium right here we get a break St start to the downside we're
looking for a continuation Confluence from the high move up then to move down is this the high right here is this the
high yes tjr it is the high good boy Timmy psych you're an idiot no it's not the high move up then a move down come
on wow I almost called you the fur we are getting we're getting deep
into this I think I can start letting things rip a little bit because if you're going to [ __ ] with me for this
long then that means you were going to [ __ ] me at the beginning anyways because at the beginning I I already said a
whole bunch of [ __ ] so if you stuck around for this long I can I can say whatever I want at this point move up
then move down low move down then move up lowest point of those two candles highest point of these two candles and
bang we got our equilibrium price moves into a premium we see a down candle out of it
Bear Run [ __ ] simple as that bro simple as
that now remember what what is not
equilibrium that is not equilibrium why because this is a random ass low this is a random ass High don't do that I know
it sounds crazy but retards do that bet bro we just slimed out equilibrium from
these lows up to these highs like what bro that does not make any sense no most recent low up to the most recent High
most recent High down to the most recent low plain and simple cold heart facts cold heart Stacks cold heart rats we got
equilibrium homework Mark out five cases of bullish equilibrium Mark out five
cases of bearish equilibrium I know just like all the other confluences I feel like I say this over and over and over
and over and over and over and over again but just like all of our other confluences this does not mean [ __ ]
without context and without being used in the right situation it's like a gun
okay a gun is super useful but without the right context and in the wrong and
in the wrong situation you're going to [ __ ] jail okay I can't walk down the street just
[ __ ] firing off rounds into the sky but if I'm in the middle if I'm in the
middle of like a [ __ ] gun whatever like a [ __ ] shooting range not a
shooting range if I'm in like the [ __ ] Forest hunting I can probably let a couple [ __ ] fly to the upside
probably not the smartest idea but maybe I will may actually I don't know the regulations on that someone be fact
check me but you get what I'm saying we can't just be firing off buys and sells
off of equilibrium like Daddy tjr taught me this I'm going to make you a billionaire no daddy he's going to make
you broke okay he is definitely going to make you broke don't listen to him again
this is this only works within the right context okay so we need
context before we have sex the last and well I was going say the most important
but it's not but hey hey don't discredit this [ __ ] though don't discredit this [ __ ] though the last Confluence that you
guys have to learn and be fluent in in order to understand the markets um is
smt Divergence okay or smt diverence okay now something that I want
to mention just right now if you guys are Forex Traders so if you guys are
trading gbpusd Euro USD gold okay if you guys are
trading any anything besides the S&P 500 in NASDAQ this is not going to apply to
you but don't leave the [ __ ] video okay don't leave the video because I have to show you how to use all these
confluences together because right now you guys are freaking clueless okay you guys are just taking trades on who knows
what right now and you guys just have all these confluences but don't know how to put them together so you guys fast
forward through the smt Divergence or just sit back relax and watch it to see if you know you maybe want to switch
over to indexes anytime maybe take notes on it why don't you but this this only
applies to indexes and I'm going to explain why so what are smt divergences
just realized my mic was down sorry if I'm now way louder than before and you
raise your volume um but smt divergences what are they why do we use
them so again let me put only on indexes so only on the S&P 500 in NASDAQ okay
and not only is it only on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ NASDAQ smoking out of your ass crack okay well no it is only on
those but okay lock in it is when one index
makes a higher high while the other
makes a lower high I think I SP spelled that right I didn't I knew I didn't God
damn it and [Music] one lower low the other
makes so you're probably saying like what the [ __ ] are you talking about tjr I don't get it when one index makes a
higher high but then the other one makes a lower high like bro what but then when one index makes a lower low and the
other one makes a higher low you're talking about Trends bro you're like on some like weird like on some like on
some like [ __ ] bro listen bro listen just listen to me bro and then bro just
the source just trust me bro anyways let's lock it smt Divergence typically
when I explain this people get confused I don't know why to me it makes complete sense but maybe that's just because
everybody's a beginner in this and we all learn at our at our own slow but sure Pace I'll try and explain this in
the best way possible let's say say the S&P 500 is in an
uptrend okay the S&P 500 is in an uptrend this
this trend line or yeah Trend shows the S&P 500 okay and since the S&P 500 and
NASDAQ are correlated indexes meaning when the S&P 500 goes up typically the
NASDAQ goes up when the S&P 500 goes down typically the NASDAQ goes down okay
so if the S&P 500 is making an uptrend then the NASDAQ is making an
uptrend okay but what happens when we have something like this where the S&P
500 is in an uptrend and makes a higher high but then
NASDAQ is in an uptrend doesn't break structure doesn't get an inverse for Value Gap but just gives us a high a
lower high that is what we call an smt smt Divergence it's when one index is
lagging behind the other and typically this happens at key levels
such as draws on liquidity okay so what typically happens
with this is the S&P 500 it's moving up it's in an uptrend and then let's say we
have a drawn liquidity right here a high time frame High we have a high time
frame High not only on the S&P 500 but also on NASDAQ sure the S&P 500 pushes
above that high but it still continues this uptrend and it hasn't given us there's no break of structure there's no
inverse for Value Gap there's nothing telling us that price is going to go down yet but on NASDAQ we're seeing the
same uptrend but hey what's that NASDAQ is making a lower high signaling a sign
of weakness signaling a potential sign of of a reversal but the S&P 500 is
moving in higher highs what is that telling me about the S&P 500 the s&p500
is lagging behind NASDAQ why because NASDAQ just pushed up into a key level
and is now making a lower high giving me signs of a reversal and if NASDAQ continues down into a downtrend then
obviously a reversal had happened so we will know that typically like when we're
right here on NASDAQ that's Ty typically when we're like right here on the S&P 500 so NASDAQ may have already broke its
structure may have already given us an inverse for Value Gap but the S&P is lagging because its price was just
behind and it literally helps us tell the future of what the other index is going to do so when we see an smt
Divergence in this case this is a bearish smt Divergence a bearish smt
Divergence is when one index it doesn't matter which one okay this one could be NASDAQ this one could be S&P 500 it
doesn't matter which one is making the higher high and which one is making the lower high cuz it it applies both ways
so let's say this one's NASDAQ NASDAQ is making higher Highs but the S&P 500 is
making a lower high off of a key level and is moving down that is a sign for me
to look at NASDAQ and say how can I find
a short trade how can I find a trade to go lower why because NASDAQ is literally telling us exactly what's about to
happen to the S&P 500 because what is about to happen to the S&P 500 just happened on NASDAQ and has already
happened on NASDAQ and NASDAQ is telling us the future of what's about to happen on the S&P 500 now it's the same thing
when it's in the opposite direction so let's say we're in a downtrend and we have a key level right here we're in
downtrend whatever we're making lower lows and lower highs let's say this is the S&P 500 and let's say need to make
sure I draw this correctly okay let's say this is the S&P 500 where we're
making lower lows still we're continuing the downtrend but this one's NASDAQ we make a higher low again we don't have a
break of structure we don't have an invers for Value Gap but we do have a higher low what is NASDAQ telling us
about the s&p500 it's saying that hey NASDAQ is actually moving higher already
off of this impact key level and the S&P 500 is about to [ __ ] follow suit and
it's about to go higher just like NASDAQ is already going higher so a bullish smt
Divergence is when one index is making lower lows while the other index is making higher lows now again just like
with every single other Confluence that I've taught you guys about the [ __ ] is he doing over there you're literally
sniffing my ass Boogie get your head out of my butt anyways just like every
single other Confluence that I've taught you guys about this means nothing without context and the key thing with
smts the biggest context clue that we need with smts is a key level because we
see smt divergences happen all the time in the chart just because NASDAQ and the S&P 500 they just straight up they just
move differently so if we're again just taking Longs purely off of NASDAQ making a a higher low and Es making uh a lower
low we're going to we're going to lose trades but when we're using it as a as a
Confluence after coming into a key level and then putting it together which is exactly what we're about to do after I
show you guys examples of this on the chart then it's actually a very very
very good Confluence for us to use so let's Show an example of this on the chart there was actually a very good
example of this yesterday so I'm going to show it beautiful example of this yesterday so this is going to be giving
us a little sneak peek into you know potentially some what the strategy looks
like a bit but we're at the point now where we understand all the confluences so what am I marking out here this is a
bearish fair value Gap we're currently in an hourly downtrend this is Market open for New York St New York Stock
Exchange okay so let's look here on the S&P 500
okay Market opens what are we in we're in a downtrend right we have a low right here a high right here a lower low a
lower high cool we're in a downtrend coming in Market open okay on
NASDAQ see what we got here when the S&P 5 00 is making a lower
high NASDAQ is making a higher high so we can see that it's literally happening
happening at the exact same time 935
935 the S&P 500 makes a lower high while NASDAQ is making a higher
high so when this happens we know that this is a bearish Confluence and we know that that means
NASDAQ is lagging index why is NASDAQ the lagging index because it made a higher high while the S&P 5 500 made a
lower high so why are we going to want to take our trade on NASDAQ because it's lagging behind the S&P and the S&P is
going to tell us literally exactly where nasdaq's going to go following that we can go through every single one of our
steps to be able to execute a trade and catch a banger short which I was able to
catch I made $25,000 on this trade don't believe me go look at the trade recap
that I posted of me making $25,000 in a day and it it was posted recently like
last week so go watch it as long as you're seeing this video as it came out obviously but that's smt Divergence in
the wild now let me try and find an example of
uh bullish smt Divergence it's been hard to find bullish smt Divergence it's been a
minute actually for us to be able to find fine bullish smt Divergence just because price action has been so bad
recently it's going to be around Market opens but again these Market opens have been so bearish recently man I wonder if
I can just show you guys one on the high time frames cuz low time frames it's really going to take forever oh this was
a high time frame one I believe okay so this is again all of our confluences
happen on every single time frame that's the awesome way about how we trade so again even though this is on a high time
frame and we're not necessarily looking at execution here we can see how this still applies NASDAQ we have a low right
here okay first of all we're in a downtrend right so we're expecting to make lower lows and lower highs right we have a low right here technically we
should be on like the daily time frame because there's a whole bunch of like lows and stuff within here but you guys
can visualize it by now at least I hope okay we have a low right here and then a higher low right here okay we can see
that this is a higher low on the s&p500 however we have the same low right here
followed by a lower low so what is NASDAQ telling us about the
S&P 500 it's saying hey buddy you better start looking for buys right here because you are lagging behind the
NASDAQ and the nasdaq's moving up and it's moving higher and it's moving quick so you better get on the [ __ ] train
and you better find a [ __ ] entry right the [ __ ] now and then boom both prices end
up going higher simple simple [ __ ] now that we understand literally everything
this is the big one we are going to put this strategy together I'm going to tell you guys how we put all these
confluences together explain how we do it on the chart and then I'm going to leave you guys with some risk management
tools okay show you guys how we can go over news data a little bit okay tell
you guys what news to avoid okay also how to calculate your risk when entering
into a trades and then I'm going to give you guys a little mindset lesson at the very end so please stay tuned to that
because not only do you have to be super good and super fluent in the charts on
like strategy wise but if your risk management is not in check you will lose
money forever in the markets and I promise you that coming from somebody that was exactly in your position just a
couple years ago my big the biggest mistakes that I ever made was actually not when it came to chartwork my
chartwork was Immaculate my chart workor was really really good however the biggest struggle that I had when trying
to learn how to day trade was protecting my mental fixing my emotions and fix
fixing my risk management so we need I I could cut this video short right after I show you guys the strategy and be like
boom now go throw your life savings on it I'm not going to do that for you guys I'm going to teach you guys how to risk
properly I'm also going to teach you guys how to get your mind in check okay and if you guys can do all three of
these things Master strategy within the market master Master risk within the market and master psychology within the
market I can promise you that along with time on the charts and just doing this
over and over and over again because it's one thing to sit here and watch this YouTube video and be like yes I
understand yes I understand and to digest the information and there's been a lot of information that I've thrown at you but you have to take that
information and then you have to go and [ __ ] apply it so if you're able to do all of that then you're going to be on a
great path but if you just sit here and watch this video and then don't do anything after that you're not going to
be able to do [ __ ] or if you just sit there watch this video Don't Journal don't try and get your mind right don't use proper risk management you're going
to be screwed and then you're going to be in my comment section saying tjr this doesn't work but I was able to make $40,000 and the week isn't even over
it's [ __ ] Wednesday of this week but you're telling me that the strategy that I'm teaching you doesn't work something
something doesn't align here what's the missing variable it's you and the work that you have yet to put in so now that
we got you all riled up let's get into how we can put all this together to actually take good trades within the
market welcome to the final strategy everything that you guys have been
learning up until now can finally be be be put together in one simple squash
it's like guacamole you get the avocado you plop it in there you get the salsa you throw
it in there you get the onions boom you give a little lime squeeze you get some garlic in there maybe some salt maybe
some Peppa steppa okay maybe your mom's maybe maybe toss a mango in that [ __ ]
right spice may maybe you never know a little pomegranate I know they like tossing them pomegranates in the
guacamole we have all these ingredients but we haven't mashed it together yet we
haven't mashed it and once and once we start mashing that's when the magic happens
baby right here right here is when the magic happens the mashing is when the magic
happens so I need you guys to lock in I know you guys are reading this and be like D I'm going to write it down cuz
this is billion dollar secret tjr is billion dollar secret is live guys I
waited 10 hours for this listen timy I'm telling you right now you're not you're
not going to turn profitable if you just take this and run to the markets is
going to take a lot of practice you guys need to do this on a demo account cuz I promise you just like this is just
before we get into the strategy portion because I know you guys have been waiting for this I need to edge you guys a little bit more okay I need to tickle
you guys I need to play with you guys I love you guys and let's just play together I I want to invite you guys
over to my house for a play dat and then maybe we can just sit and read books and play all day but I also want to tell you
guys something this is similar I'm like LeBron okay I'm I'm
65 you know he's 67 I'm good at basketball he's good at
basketball he's black I'm black I want to be black you know we're like the same
dude pretty much but if LeBron made a course or gave you guys TR basketball
training videos right and you guys were to sit down if he gave you guys like an 8 hour 10 hour whatever basketball
training video you sit down and you watch it and you're like yep I understand I understand I understand and
then you guys go and hit the black top and then you try and apply everything that big daddy Braun told you guys about
in those trading videos and then after the first day you miss every single shot you suck at dribbling you suck at
passing your IQ is [ __ ] do you go to Big Daddy braa and say yo bro what the [ __ ]
you suck at basketball you're a [ __ ] liar you're a [ __ ] scammer no you look at yourself and say
I need a practice more that's exact that's the same thing with trading trading is seen so horribly by the
masses I'm sure a lot of you guys think day trading is the easiest [ __ ] in the world it's not day trading is by far
like it's literally the opposite of a get-rich quick scheme the reason why there's no such thing as getting rich
quick okay every most people that get into day trading they just want to get rich quick I'm telling you right now
that's not how this [ __ ] works but I am telling you that you can get rich from trade trading I'm telling you without a
[ __ ] doubt in my mind that you can get riched from Trading why because I was able to do that [ __ ] too so I believe in every single one of you guys
and I know I can see literally a 100 times more potential in you guys than you can see in yourselves and I know for
a fact that you guys can get this but I need you guys to understand that if you
guys just take this strategy and go and apply it tomorrow and then give up because it didn't work it's not because the strategy doesn't work it's because
you didn't work hard enough and you guys haven't put in enough work yet for this to work you guys have to get into the
markets every single day you guys have to back test every single day you guys have to journal your trades you guys
have to get your psychology right you guys have to get your risk management right there's so many other things outside of this than just the strategy
so yes am I going to lay this out for you guys and give you guys the strategy that I use to take trades 100% I am
because that because I want you guys to succeed in this but no one understand that day trading is far more than just
this one strategy and this is going to take you to the moon and the stars because I promise you guys you guys are
probably marking out confluences wrong just like when I hit a crossover am I going to hit my first crossover as good
as Big Daddy braa no but after I hit my H 100th crossover is my 100th crossover
going to be better than my first one is my H 100th trade going to be better than my first one yes it is what happens when
I hit my thousandth trade is it going to be better than my first one yes is it going to be way better than my 100th
trade yes and the more trades that we take the more losses that we take the
more lessons that we learn from the market itself the better that we're going to get at trading so it's one
thing for you guys to watch this video but the second thing that I can't help you guys do is put in the work
yourselves and that's the hardest thing about getting rich the easiest thing ever is to put in your head that you're
going to [ __ ] do it the easiest thing about getting rich is telling yourself I'm going to do it and I'm going to get
the Supercar and I'm going to and I'm going to have a billion dollars I'm going to be a millionaire but the
hardest part about getting rich is actually doing what you say you're going to do the hardest part about getting rich is waking up in the morning when
you don't want to and actually putting in the [ __ ] work the hardest part about getting rich is doing the work
when you don't want to and you know everybody else is quitting and it's super easy for you to quit at that point
in time but then guess what you're going to be just like everybody else who quit and didn't make it so the choice is
yours whether you guys want to make this [ __ ] or not there's a reason why only 3% of day Traders succeed matter of fact
it's probably even lower that there's a reason why only 1% of day Traders succeed because that 1% of people
they're different than 99% of the other people they're willing to do what 99% of people aren't willing to do which is put
in the [ __ ] work and the same thing applies to literally anything else in business so whether you're watching this
just cuz you're thinking about getting into trading or you're watching this just cuz you like my videos I don't give
a [ __ ] whatever it is you're watching my videos cuz you want to succeed in life and you know that I'm young I'm 22 years
old and I'm a [ __ ] multi millionaire and I made this life out from the [ __ ] ground up by myself on my
[ __ ] own and if you guys want to be like me I can promise you you guys can
and I can promise you that some of you guys can be even [ __ ] greater than me but I can also promise you this if you
don't put in the work that's required to get to these levels you will never make it ever in your entire life and there
are going to be points in your life where you're [ __ ] hitting a brick wall and you're like man I can't get
through this [ __ ] but you got to just put your head down and keep running into that [ __ ] wall day after day until it
breaks down and then boom you're on to the next level and you grow and you learn from those mistakes that you made
and then guess what I still run into roadblocks in my own life and you're probably thinking damn this dude's got his life set he's got a bris he's got a
[ __ ] Rolls-Royce he's got a crib in Puerto Rico he's living all on his own he's got life figured out [ __ ] no I
don't I don't have life figured out for [ __ ] there's new problems at every single level you guys are at an early
level right now your problems are [ __ ] easy compared to my problems more money more problems that shit's as real as it gets but I would much rather
deal with the problems that I'm dealing with now than have to be dealing with [ __ ] ass problems like paying rent
on time like like just putting [ __ ] food on the table bro there was times when I was door dashing where I was
literally stealing [ __ ] orders just to eat bro there there was literally times when I was door dashing [ __ ]
orders and I would go I would walk up to the door and I would wait for them to answer it so I could get cash from them
to put gas in my car so I could keep door dashing that's the type of [ __ ] that I was on and I know for a fact
there's some of you guys that are watching this that are probably in worse situations that I was in I can promise
you there's a way out of that situation it's not just from watching one single video it's from putting in hours and
hours and hours of work and that's the only only way that you guys are going to make it but would you rather put in
hours and hours and hours and hours of work into something that is infinitely scalable or would you rather just go
through the same dayto day that you guys have been living for the for your entire life just over and over and over again groundhog [ __ ] day you got wake up
damn same shift same boss same [ __ ] or would you rather wake up and have to
deal with problems that are exciting I got to deal with a whole bunch of [ __ ] every single day but I know
that I I know now at the level that I'm at these problems these things that I'm dealing with it's fun I'm I'm ready for
the challenges that my life brings me why because I know when I knock these challenges down I'm going to keep going
I'm going to keep getting better I'm going to keep growing right now you guys see see problems as a bad thing you guys
see challenges as a bad thing I see them as growth opportunities and you guys need to see them too as growth
opportunities and I just wanted to get that through your guys' head before I go into this strategy and I'm going to go
deeper into psychology and how you guys can actually get this life that you guys want and [ __ ] dream of but man
doesn't come with a lot of [ __ ] hard work and sacrifice there there's no avoiding it so I'm telling you right now
for everybody that's that's watching this and just thinks that they're going to take this strategy and just go
laughing to the bank and telling all their friends about it like yeah that is going to be the case after you fall on
your face hundreds of times after attempting this over and over and over and over again this is the strategy that
I use on a daily basis that I make a [ __ ] ton of money with but I can promise you your first trade you're probably going to lose your second trade it's
going to suck as well cuz you guys just don't understand this [ __ ] well enough as time goes on and as you guys rewatch
this video as you guys get get more in touch with the market get more into your flow state with the market you guys
eventually will get this [ __ ] and all that hard work will pay off so with that being said let's get into our strategy
there are three things that we are going to be looking for the first thing is our key levels what are our key levels draws
on liquidity and imbalances the market moves off of draws on liquidity and imbalances so why are those our key
levels because that's what the market moves off of what are draws on liquidity highs and lows within the market what
are imbalances fair value gaps where do we look for these on the 1H hour time frame and the 4H hour time frame we are
also looking for the session highs and lows so I'm going to show you guys how
to Mark out the session opens okay and how to find the highs and lows of each session because these session highs and
lows are super strong draws on liquidity and very high Confluence for us the second thing that we need to know are
when can we trade okay there are like I said there are three sessions I would prefer if if you guys don't trade Asian
session if you guys are trading New York session so this is for indexes I'll go ahead and add Forex here so for indexes
I'm only looking to trade from 950 to 1030 I know you're probably thinking damn that's not much time to trade I
know we're going to be on the market before that ideally 30 minutes before
Market opens so we can see and react to price and whatever we're not just getting on the onto the charts 20
minutes into Market open no we're getting onto the charts 30 minutes before Market opens maybe even an hour
before Market opens ideally it's an hour before Market opens if you guys are just getting into this but we're looking to take our trade from between 950 and
10:30 and then for Forex the Forex so New York Stock Exchange opens at 9:30 a.m. eastern time
pre-market for New York Stock Exchange opens at 8:30 a.m. eastern time that's for indexes and like stocks and stuff
and again I trade indexes which is the S&P 500 and NASDAQ but for people who are trading for Forex so let's say you
want to trade like GBP USD or Euro USD during New York session because that's what works for you guys 8 a.m. eastern
time 210 a.m. eastern time are going to be
your guys' times to trade okay that's Forex and then London session London
session opens at 300 a.m. all of all of this is done in Eastern time and I'm going to keep it as eastern time because
I operate based I'm I'm not not even on Eastern Time right now I'm in Puerto Rico we're an hour ahead of Eastern time
but I fully like my entire brain and my entire schedule operates off of eastern time because that's how the markets
operate so London session opens at 3:00 a.m. eastern time and ideally you guys
find your trade between 3:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. I highly recommend you guys don't take any trades after 4:00 a.m. on
London session same thing here on New York session if you guys can't find a trade after 10:30 me personally I would
avoid trading for for that entire day Forex same thing if you guys can't find a trade from 8: to 10: a.m. I would
avoid trading for that entire day now finally we got to what you guys came
here for how to place the [ __ ] trade the first thing that we are looking for is our key levels we are
going to Mark these out on the chart the first thing that we're waiting to do waiting for is for price to hit a key
level when price hits a key level whether it's a 1hour high 4our high 1
hour low 4H hour low a London sessions High London sessions low Asian sessions
High Asian sessions low previous day high previous day low whatever it may be
maybe a 1hour fair value Gap maybe a 4H hour fair value Gap whatever it may be we are waiting for price to hit these
key levels then following that we are going to scale down to the five minute
time frame and we are going to wait for a confirmation Confluence so and I'm I'm
going to show you guys this on the chart but we're going to scale down to the 5minute time frame we wait for our
confirmation Confluence whether that be a 5 minute break of structure a 5 minute inverse fair value
Gap or a 5 minute smt Divergence once that happens are we entering no because
that just means okay the trend has shifted but we want to know for sure and let me draw this out for you
guys so let's say we have our key level here and let's just say we want to take a short trade and we push into our key
level to the upside boom and then we get a 5 minute break of structure so this is
where we're at right now we're on the 5 minute the 5 minute's in an uptrend up to that key level obviously right
because it needs to move up to get to that key level and then we get a 5 minute break of structure after that
what's next in our process we're looking for either a 5 minute fair value Gap 5
minute order block 5 minute breaker block or 5 minute equilibrium for price
to retrace into once price goes into one of those
confluences we're going down to the one minute time frame so that's literally just right when price goes into fair
value Gap order Block Breaker block whatever it may be we're going down into the 1 minute now when we make that 5
minute retrace up at least in this case up typically there's going to be a one
minute uptrend formed going leading
into this Confluence because 5 minute retrace up
even if the 5 minute time frame is in a downtrend the one minute can be in an uptrend pushing giving us that retrace
into that Confluence because we're in an uptrend on the one minute in order to wait for
confirmation because we're in this Confluence that we're going to go down what do we wait for we wait for a trend
shift on the one minute so whether that be an inverse fair value Gap or a break of structure on the one minute we wait
for that to happen and then we enter our stop loss is placed above or
below again depending on if you're buying or selling where the trade idea is invalidated or wrong so let's say I
take this trade off of a this fair value Gap where am I going to want to put my stop- loss above the fair value Gap
because that's what my trade idea is based off of it's based off of that this value Gap is providing a continuation
Confluence for price to keep going down and if price pushes past that fair value Gap then my trade idea was wrong where
are we looking to take profit well just like how we marked out key levels to the
upside up here we're also going to have key levels to the downside we want to
Mark out every single key level so there might be a 1 hour fair value gap down here there might be a 4H hour low down
here there might be London session low right
here those are going to be our take profits we are going to look for price to go down into those other key
levels and why are we looking to take profit at those key levels because they have a high
probability for price to reverse back up or at least in this trade's case this
trade we were taking a short trade okay so I know all that sounds crazy I know that sounds a bit confusing
but we're going to go ahead and try and apply this now I highly recommend you guys write
this down in your notes and drill through this as many times as possible on the chart okay let's uh let's go
ahead and show the example from yesterday okay so let's go back to our
list key levels where do we mark them out 1 Hour 4 Hour okay we're looking for highs and lows on the 1 hour and the 4
Hour and fair value value gaps on the 1 hour and 4 Hour on top of that we are also looking for session highs and
session lows now if you guys forgot from the beginning of this video when do the session start that's something that I
want to mention here well London session starts at 3:00 a.m. eastern time and
Asian session starts at 1800 eastern time so let's go ahead and
Mark Mark out our session levels first for this day we have Asian session
highs we have Asian session lows London session
highs London session
lows okay this is Asian session where's the highest point that Asian session got
to right here where's the lowest point that Asian session got to right here this is London session where is the
highest point that London session got to right here where's the lowest point that London session got to right here now if
we can see that Asian session's low has already been pushed past we no longer
care about it because that's no longer valid as a draw on liquidity remember we're marking these out as draws on
liquidity so now that we've marked out our session highs and session lows let's go ahead and Mark out our 4our highs and
4our lows so we actually don't really have we actually don't have any 4-Hour
highs and 4-Hour lows for us to Mark out besides this one right here that was
already marked out which it was Asian sessions High we do have a 4-Hour fair value Gap right here but this was
already filled in okay and had already been reacted off of so we no longer care about that we
have this 4H hour low right here but it's already been pushed past so we don't care about it so there's really no
fair value gaps and no lows or highs on the 4 Hour that I really want to care
about you're probably saying what what about this High well price isn't going to move all the way up there and take out this High we just have to know and
understand if this is where price is opening it's not going to move all the way up here and move 2.7% in a day and
those are small things that you guys will pick up as time goes on okay now let's mark out our 1eh hour confluences
well we have a 1 hour high right here we have a 1 hour low right here but it gets
taken out before Market even opens at 9:30 so I'm going to go ahead and delete that we have this 1 hour low right here
move down then a move up and this is actually Asian or sorry this is actually London sessions low so we don't have to
mark that out because it's already been marked and really the only thing that we have left here is this 1 hour fair value
Gap so that's how I Mark out my key levels we marked out every single one of our key levels for the day awesome so we
have one these Asian session highs these London session highs this 1 hour high
this 1 hour fair value Gap and the London session lows pretty solid so now that we marked
out our key levels what's next we're looking for our times to trade so I'm looking to trade from 950 to 10:30
that's when I'm willing to be able to place my trades okay so cool let's go ahead and Mark that out on the
chart 950 to 10:30 boom
cool now I know all of this is super overwhelming but trust trust me we're almost there we've marked out our key
levels we marked out the times that we're willing to trade and most of the time I don't even have these lines on the chart I only have the session lines
on the chart but just here I'll get rid of the 10:30 line cuz we don't really need that but this is typically when I'm
looking to take trades okay now that we have all this marked out let's go through our step by step the first thing
that we need to wait for price to do is to go into a key level okay so Market opens on this
Candlestick right here right we push down and we actually take out these London session lows so cool key level
got hit but then we don't see a break of structure on the 5 minute we don't see an inverse for Value gap on the 5 minute
we don't see anything we actually push back we push into this 1 hour key level
and then this was the example of the smt that I showed you so off of this no smt Divergence no break of structure no
inverse for Value gap on the 5- minute time frame we don't break structure to the upside we don't get an inverse for
Value Gap and we don't get an smt Divergence however what we do get is
this 1hour fair value Gap that gets filled and then what did we have in smt Divergence so we entered into a key
level we got our confirmation Confluence our confirmation Confluence
was this smt Divergence we're looking to take the trade on
NASDAQ so now what are we looking for well we're looking for either
equilibrium to get hit we are looking for fair value Gap looking for order
block looking for breaker block okay now this one is actually kind of a a weird
situation here so where is the order block and where is the breaker block well we break structure to the downside
right here and we actually maintain the bearish structure right prior to this we
were in an uptrend we break structure right here we don't break structure back to the upside so we're still in bearish
structure here so this move up is
technically a fill of equilibrium in a sense okay I know that sounds like
really ridiculous and whatever but this move up is a Confluence getting hit not
only in the smt Divergence but because we had were we were still in this downtrend cuz most of
the time when we get an Divergence were or at least a bearish smt Divergence we in an uptrend right
but in this case we were already in a downtrend so this move up was not only
our confirmation Confluence but also our continuation
Confluence so following that I'm like okay cool again remember the only time
that I'm willing to trade is at 950 so we make this move up make that smt Divergence and hit equilibrium and
actually go far past equilibrium and we also go into this order block and so this right here is the order block on
the 5 minute and this right here is the breaker block come on on the 5 minute
this move down is the breaker and this move up is the order block we push into both of those and we actually go above
both of those and that was like the example on the order block part where I was saying like if we do go above the
order Block it's not touching into the order block It's actually an smt that's exactly what this is and then we get a
one minute break of structure right here so you're probably saying well this is when you enter right no could we have
entered right here sure on this Candlestick closure underneath here not only do we get a one minute break of
structure to the downside on this candle closure but we also get a inverse fair
value Gap right here but it's not 950 yet so I just have to sit on my hands and wait when 950 finally hits we're
actually back in an uptrend on the 1 minute and I'm not willing to take that trade just yet until we get what a break
of structure back down to the downside on the 1 minute or an inverse for Value
Gap to the downside on the 1 minute we get that actually right at 1 15 or at 950 we get an inverse fair value Gap
right here right when this candle closes boom 950 opens that is when I'm going to want to be taking my short
position okay my stop loss I can either put it
right above this inverse for Value Gap I can put it above these highs wherever your trade idea gets invalidated so this
trade I'm taking it off of this inverse for Value Gap maybe I just put it right above the inverse for Value Gap and then
targeting well we look at our key levels we have this right here boom that's a 1 to 1.7 risk reward ratio so if you go in
with go in with $100 you're making 170 bucks or 171
bucks on this trade or if you go in with $1,000 or risk
$1,000 you're making 1,700 in 10 bucks okay now is this the one and only
takeprofit that we need so when I showed you guys on trade Locker how there's multiple partial closes that how you can
take profits at certain points it's the same thing with this is this a good trade yes for sure but could we
potentially see price go even lower yeah for sure so that's when we can go and
look to the left a bit because we don't have anything in recent price data that
we can use for take profits so this is when we can go over here and look and we
can see okay well this is a 4H hour low this is a draw on liquidity on the high
time frame so it's a key level this is a 4our low so this is a draw in liquidity
on the high time frame this is a key level this is a 4our Lev low this is a draw liquidity a key level on the high
time frame all of those are able to be take profits and look at that price goes
and hits every single one of them and respects it to a t oh look how cool this
is respects it to a T and then following that what does price do an inverse fair
value Gap off of a key level on the 5 minute followed by a retracement Down
into what is this an order block followed by a move up you enter off that stops underneath these lows what happens
boom price moves up right after that this [ __ ] is it's so beautiful man thank God for
trading thank God for trading it's so beautiful okay I know that was super
overwhelming and a lot of information so again let's just go through this slowly
but surely we marked out our key Lev LS our key levels are 1our highs 4our highs
1H hour fair value gaps 4H hour fair value gaps and session highs and session lows session highs and session lows are
important draws on liquidity because when every when a new session starts there are new Traders and new smart
money new market makers new algorithms that are being applied to the market so when these New Market Movers come into
the market previous algorith algorithms that were on the market they stop okay
new money comes into the market and says I want price to do this so what are they going to do they are going to manipulate
the previous session take out all the previous Traders from the past session
and then make price going the way that it wants to go we can visually see this on this day
perfectly these London session lows we see price boom immediately we take out
these London session lows goodbye London session Traders but on top of that we have these London session highs in these
Asian session highs what does price do right after it takes out those London session lows boom Another leg of
manipulation we take out London session Traders and we take out Asian session Traders something that I want to show
you guys specifically for my Forex people and how this applies to you guys
look here it's the same thing with London session and Asian session we have Asian session highs Asian session lows
look right when London session opens we immediately manipulate the Asian session
low and then get legs up I'm telling you bro this Market
it there is a rhyme and a reason to why and how it moves and you guys are slowly
but surely going to get the hang of this okay let's do another example okay so
for this next example it is literally the following day um so we just came
from Tuesday's price action we are now going to Monday's price action so this
is Monday's price action on March 3rd 2025 what are we going to do Mark out
our key levels we'll start with the session highs so do this on the hourly it'll be a
little bit easier bless me London session
highs London session lows Asian session highs Asian session
lows okay now sorry I kind of sped through that but again this this is London session boom from 3: to 9:30 or
actually it's 3: to 8:30 again because New York premarket opens at 8:30 so again if like let's say
830 the 8:30 high is was higher than this that
wouldn't count um we would look for the high that's prior to 8:30 so technically we're looking for London session highs
and lows before this point it's only when we're trading indexes and for Forex
your Market open is going to be at 8 so I know that's that's really confusing I know we literally have like three
different Market opens but when we're marking out London session highs and lows for New York Stock Exchange on
indexes we are looking for them before 8:30 okay and then when we're looking
for London session highs and lows for 4ex we are looking for them before 8
okay so we have London session High Asian session High we can go ahead and
disregard Asian session High why because London session has already pushed above it so the key level has already been
pushed through and there is no reaction off of it then we have London session low and Asian session low okay let's
look at our 4our we have this bearish for Value Gap but it already got
disrespected so we'll go ahead and get rid of that we have this 4our High which was
the Asian Asian session high but we already pushed above that so we can go ahead and disregard that we have this 4H
hour High which is you know a little bit close to London session high so we might as well Mark it we also have this 4-Hour
fair value Gap all the way up here but eh I don't really see much use in marking that out because it's above two
highs and if Market really wants to push up there then we can mark it as the market starts to push we have this 4H
hour fair value Gap right here now that's pretty much everything on the 4 Hour let's go down to the 1 hour we have
a 1 hour low right here we have another 1 hour low right here and then we have
this is the 4H hour fair value gap which is overlapping with this 1 hour fair value Gap and then last but not least we
have this tiny little 1 hour fair value Gap right here I don't really bother with marking
out these hourly lows just because they're so far down from where Market is
going to be opening at might as well disregard them even though price did end up going all the way down there I'm
going to disregard them because I know my pre-market itself would completely disregard these things so let's go
through our steps again when are we looking to trade at 950 so we'll go ahead and put that on
there ah let's do the same thing for the S&P 500 before we forget the S&P
500 London session highs right here London session lows
right here Asian session highs right here Asian session lows right here we
can go ahead and disregard Asian session High because London session had already moved past them without a reaction and
then let's go into the 4H hour to see if we see anything we have a 4-Hour fair value Gap right here awesome draw on
liquidity or awesome pull we have this 4-Hour high right here see that's something that I'm willing to Mark out
we also have this 4our high up here but there's no reason to mark it it's pretty far from where Market is going to be
opening at and if price decides to push all the way up there then we can go ahead and Mark it um when the time
comes so we'll we'll do this on NASDAQ just because this was the trade that I
took Market opens at 9:30 we push above London session highs and what do we end
up making an smt Divergence again this time it's a bearish smt Divergence or
the past one was a bearish smt Divergence as well sorry smt Divergence how do we know
there's an S&T Divergence because on the S&P 500 when Market opens London session
highs do we push above London session highs no we make a lower high so what index and am I going to be
looking at for today's trading day NASDAQ because NASDAQ is the lagging index the S&P 500 is telling us telling
the future that hey we're going to go down so now that we get boom key level
pushed in a or a confirmation Confluence and not to mention we get a
5minute break of structure to the downside right here as well so technically two confirmation confluences
as if we needed more more what are we looking for we're looking for fair value gaps order blocks and breaker blocks now
on the 5 minute this blue candle right here is our order
block these two down black candles are our breaker
block equilibrium would literally have to be drawn from this high all the way down to this low
but that's not happening because we're trying to take our trade right the freak now what's the last
Confluence that we have fair value Gap so we don't hit the order block we
don't hit the breaker block equilibrium you know it's going to be all the way down here but what do we do we end up
filling in this fair value Gap we see price push into this fair value Gap scale
down we break one minute structure to the upside to fill in this five minute
Confluence so what are we waiting for either a one minute break of structure
or a 1 minute inverse fair value Gap we have the one minute low right here and the fair value Gap right here that we're
waiting for it to be inverse both of them H happen at the same time on this Candlestick closure underneath this Gap
and underneath this low we can go ahead and enter into a short position we can either put our
stops Above This high or above the inverse for Value Gap whatever you guys see fit whatever whatever you guys want
whatever you guys took the trade off of Target
are other key levels that we had these are backtack days within the market where I just went step by step showing
you guys the exact strategy that I just laid out in front of you and how you guys can take winning trades doing that
backtack days Monday and Tuesday and I took both of these trades and you guys can watch the trade Recaps on them I
took both of these trades we go down we take out London session low we take out this 1 hour low we take out Asian
session low and then we go down to fill in this fair value Gap and we fill completely
actually and then would you look at that we take out key levels and then get a mini reversal off of
it if you thought day trading was a lie if you thought day trading was a scam I hate to break it to you I just proved
you [ __ ] wrong and I'm going to keep proving you guys wrong every single day with my trade Recaps obviously I make
mistakes here and there I am not perfect nobody's perfect in the market okay I
take losses all the time that's just part of the day trading game game but that is how you guys can execute trades
on a daily basis following that step by step is it systematic no because it's
different confluences every day right on Tuesday the day prior this we didn't
have a fair value Gap what did we have we had equilibrium this day we have a fair value Gap yes both of them were off
whatever High time frame liquidity or sorry session liquidity sweeps with smt Divergence but
some days there might not be an smt Divergence there might just be a regular liquidity sweep and then a 5-minute
break structure to the downside and then an order block getting filled and then it's a one minute inverse for Value Gap
entry okay that's why we have to be fluent and that's why I ask you guys to you know make sure we know and
understand these confluences before getting into this because if you guys don't don't understand these then you guys are going to miss out on
opportunities from the market but once you guys understand these holy smokes you guys are going to be able to find opportunity from the market pretty much
every single day and that that is how I would approach day trading okay and actually executing now like I promised
and like I told you guys that's not everything that's just one piece of the puzzle and I'm I'm kind of shooting
myself in the foot here because I know I'm going to have to make this video longer but I'm doing you guys a huge
favor by going over psychology and by going over risk management and those are two Super Key super super important
parts of day trading that you guys just really really have to know in order to be a profitable Trader it's it's
literally a non-negotiable so if you guys think that you're set for life because you have tjr strategy I advise
you to stick around because we need to know about how to manage our risk within the markets and also how to manage our
heads and I know that sounds dumb but it's one of the it's one of the most
powerful tools and also it's going to be one of the hardest things for you guys to get over within your own trading is
psychology and the effect that it has on your own trading so with that being said
let's get into how to figure out how much we are going to be risking per trade okay so this is going to be risk
management explained and I'm going to try and do this the best of my abilities understanding that every single Trader
is different every single person's win rate is going to be different every single person's average risk reward is
going to be different so when we're going over this first of all what even
is risk to reward you guys saw me using these tools when I was showing you guys
entering into trades so this is a short trade for example so up here I kind of use this to show where I want my trade
to go right the top of this gray box is where my stop- loss is the bottom of this blue box is where my takeprofit is
the middle is where I enter at so if my stop loss is up here and my take profit
is right let's say let's put this right perfect okay right here for example this
is a 1 to 2.02 risk reward ratio how do I know that because this is telling me
so again we know where to put our stop losses and we know where to put our take profits so that's already sorted out
right we already taught you guys about that in the chart portion we put our stop loss above or if we're taking a buy
position below where our trade idea gets invalidated matter of fact hold on I
need to show you guys a buy I just realized I need to show you guys a buy position position um example really
quick let me just Speed Run and try and find a buy position example okay buy position example
speedrun Market open we won't fully speedrun this we'll do it for your guys'
sake because I love you guys no other Mentor is willing to get on here for [ __ ] hours on end London session
highs London session lows so Asian
[Music] session Asian session highs we can go ahead and disregard these because London
session already moved past them with no reaction Asian session lows
okay not only that let's look at our hourly we
have an hourly low right here we have an hourly fair value Gap
right here but it already got filled and got a reaction off of it so we can go ahead and
disregard this this one however has not been filled yet I mean it gets filled
but hasn't been filled yet and then we have hourly highs all the way up here but knowing that Market
opens down here is price really going to jump all the way up here to take out liquidity probably not so I know I
didn't go on the 4 Hour but we don't we don't need to because the entries are
here so let's get into this Market opens what do we do we take out
our key levels London session lows we took take these out we take out hourly lows and we take out these Asian session
lows what are we looking for next we want to look at the time that we're going to trade 950
boom okay we're looking at current current price action we have this
potential bearish fair value Gap this bearish fair value Gap that could potentially get inversed
do we inverse it the first time no but do we inverse it the second time yes we get an inverse right here awesome now
what are we looking for 5 minute time frame Confluence so we end up continuing
higher and you're probably freaking out and I we're going to talk about this in in the psychology class soon don't worry
soon but you guys are going to get fear of missing out because we're getting so close to our takeprofit we're getting so close to London session high is like ah
I just want to take this trade you got to be patient patience you got to be super patient
we have to wait until we get a 5-minute retrace boom 5 minute retrace where's our order block this
move down this is the move down that cause what the liquidity sweep where's our breaker block boom
this is our breaker block it comes into not only our order block our breaker block there's no fair value
gaps but it also comes into equilibrium awesome so it hits three confluences we
can choose from whatever the [ __ ] Confluence we want it's giving us a whole bunch of options
this is the retrace what are we waiting for either a one minute break of structure or a 1 minute inverse for
Value Gap we get both ideally we enter on the one minute inverse for Value Gap because that gives
us a better entry you can go ahead and put your stop loss either underneath these
lows or underneath these lows whatever it may be I would probably put it just a little bit underneath these lows cuz
this is where our tra our trade idea is off this inverse value Gap and the there's no reason to put your stop loss so tight right here okay might as well
just have it underneath these lows one to 1.78 risk reward ratio boom there's
another example for you guys Banger long position but anyways what I was saying
let's look at this now that we have this in front of us this is our entry this is
our stop loss our stop- loss is always going to be a set fixed loss
amount okay our take profits are going to be what's variable so our stop our
stop loss we're always going to be losing the same like ideally the same dollar amount per trade ideally our take
profits are what is variable so again if my take profits all the way up here then we have a one to 3.22 risk reward ratio
so what even is a risk reward ratio in the first place it means for every one that I risk I'm getting X in return or
whatever it says right here in return so if I risk $11,000 and I win this trade
and it hits takeprofit then I will make
$3,220 if I risk $100 on this trade I will make
$322 if I risk $1 on this trade I will make
$322 if this is my takeprofit if I risk $100 I make 100
$78 you guys get the gist of it by now that is what risk reward is ideally
we are only taking risk to rewards that are one to one and higher because at
that point in time if we have a lower risk reward ratio than 1: one then the odds are against us meaning we're
risking more than we're about to win there's no reason to take that trade and there's going to be times where you guys
just straight up you guys have a bad risk reward ratio where your stop loss where your trade idea gets invalidated
all the way down here and your takeprofit is going to be right here is this a one:1 risk reward ratio no so are
you going to take this trade no now that we understand that let's talk about this
there are two types of Traders Traders with a high risk reward
meaning they look for trades like this a one to 8 65 risk reward Ratio or a 1 to 10
risk reward ratio meaning for every one that they risk they get 10
back but those Traders have a low win rate so in turn they they have a low win
rate meaning they probably only win 30% of their
trades but if on those wins they're making way more than what they're losing
per trade they're still profitable Traders but but because they have such a
low win rate they are going to have to use lower risk so they are going to have to risk less of their account per trade
in order to just keep their account alive okay because they know hey I can I
could potentially go on a losing streak I could potentially lose 70 trades in a row out of a 100 before I get my one win
or before I get whatever 30 wins in a row to make it all back and be profitable and they have to allocate for
for that so they have to use lower risk or you can be on the other side of the Spectrum which is the trader that I am
where I get a low risk reward so most of the time my risk reward is anywhere from
like 1 to 1 point5 one to two one to three 1 to four
sometimes if it's a crazy trade with a high win rate I have a high win rate I win a lot of the trades that I take but
I have a lowrisk reward but because I have a high win rate but a lower risk
reward and in order to get more out of my trades I can risk a little bit more
does that mean I go crazy on the risk no does that mean I'm risking 10% on my account per trade absolutely not because
that means I only have 10 shots before my account is gone 10 10% risk trade trades means 100%
of your account is gone if you lose all of them and there are times where you will lose 10 trades in a row I have been
there for it sucks but you will get out of it losing streaks happen all the time
especially like no matter what if you're profitable Traders it's just like hot and cold streaks sometimes they're just
hitting like crazy right now I'm hitting like crazy I'm up 40K on the week but I
I just know for a fact eventually this win streak it's going to be done and I'm probably going to lose some money but
that's just trading for you you have to know and understand we are going to lose so by knowing and understand we are
going to lose lose we have to we have to lower our risk a little bit so what does lower risk versus higher risk look like
me personally I'm risking anywhere from 1 to 3% of my account per trade that's for a
higher that's for higher risk traders that have a high win rate and a low risk
reward for the high Riser reward and the lower win rate people you guys are
probably going to want to be risking 0.25 to 1% of your total account size per trade so what does that mean that
means if I have a $100 account if I'm a higher risk person I'm going to be risking $1 to $3 per trade if I have
$100 in my account and I'm a lower risk Trader I'm going to be risking 25 cents
to $1 per trade I know it doesn't sound really that cool and really that amazing
right when you're only able to risk a dollar with a100 $100 account
well that's the reality of trading it's not a get-rich quick scheme I already told you guys that it's it's slow and
steady slow and steady wins the race in trading you keep stacking wins with minimal losses and eventually you get
freaking paid and there's also a whole bunch of different tools that I won't
cover in this video that can help assist with you guys getting getting capital and leveraging your Capital like The
Brokerage that I that I showed you guys that's a really good place to start okay
in terms of leveraging your own Capital so this is how I would be risking based on whatever type of Trader you are and
if you're saying well how do I know what type of Trader are I am well you simply just look at these statistics and you're
saying well how do I find these statistics you got a journal your trades so that leads me into the next thing
which is going to help us with psychology and which is a perfect merger over to the very last skill set that we
need to learn in order to be a profitable Trader yes I know you're seeing the video is being clo close to being done don't worry you're almost
there you're almost there I promise you you're almost there okay you're almost freaking there so you want to figure out
what's my average risk reward what's my average win rate you got to journal your trades and this is going to be super
helpful when it comes to psychology and managing your emotions within the market and this is also going to be super helpful when trying to figure this out
so what are what what are the pieces of data that you guys want to be tracking in your trading journal the first thing
the amount of game that I'm dropping on this video is actually [ __ ] it's actually insane how how in-depth I'm
going in on this bro I haven't I haven't done this in a while I haven't done a I I actually
don't think I've ever done this this full comprehensive A to Z trading in one
single video before I don't think I've ever done this this is by far the longest video that I've dropped crazy
amount of game going on right now be blessed it's actually nuts how I would
have paid bro I would have paid I would have paid two to like $33,000 for this just this video back
when I was learning how to trade thank God I am my like old unprofitable self
favorite Mentor like every single video that I'm making that I make on YouTube is like for my old unprofitable self so
he can turn profitable and he is you guys so shout out old unprofitable Tyler
anyways in my trade journal what am I going to mark down whether I won or whether I lost the next
thing whoa chill what pair
what what pair what pair did you trade trade on
what was your bias so what key levels did you think price
was going to go into why did you take the trade what were your confluences okay we need to understand
what why you took the trade what pair was it was it Euro USD was it gold was it the S&P 500 was it NASDAQ did you win
did you lose what was your bias on the trade what was your risk to
reward what was your risk reward and post nut Clarity no this is not a joke
you think I'm joking it's not a joke I'm telling you right now you think I'm joking it's not a joke you
will find the urge to Edge during pre-market you will find the urge you will find yourself
grabbing your [ __ ] as Market is opening slowly
stroking slowly gaining an erection and after you placed your trade
you realize it's all over the screen and you have post nut Clarity you have post
trade clarity and you need to write down what your post trade Clarity
is just like how in those moments when at the time you're hammered
you're blackout drunk and you see a whale and you got to put up a buzzer
beater shot you take her home and you bet it just ah you bang
her you [ __ ] and the second that you look up from that EX excruciating
nut what have I done I hit that
raw there's no way you will have those exact same
thoughts with trades you will take a horrific trade and you will put real
life money on it because you've convinced yourself that this is a good
trade and then you nut stoploss gets
hit post trade Clarity hits the money's gone the nut is gone the thrill the urge
of taking a trade is gone and the
reality it sets in what have you done you need to journal your post Trade Post
nut Clarity there are going to be some trades where you win you piped a bad
[ __ ] that night ain't [ __ ] to talk about don't even have to go over the over the post
post game analysis coach I got in and I got out I wrapped up no STD
clean we did what we needed to do get that nut off
and boom it's wraps clean product post nut Clarity W in the chat
should and would do it again that's a w trade but at the
beginning of the dating scene you're [ __ ] everything okay the post nut clarities are going to hit hard just
like your post trade clarities are going to hit real [ __ ] hard for you guys okay you guys are going to be like what the [ __ ] was I thinking on this trade
because your emotions got the best of you your psychology you're all [ __ ] up because you're so excited to take a trade you're so excited to just get your
nut off you're so horny and you don't think about what you're doing in the moment until you're an experienced
rizzler and you get into the bar and you're like fat [ __ ] fat [ __ ] Cho
[ __ ] ugly [ __ ] maybe a 35 Old 35-year-old [ __ ] don't want him dime
piece in the corner the only one in the bar that's attractive that's the trade that I want
to take and you're maneuvering ducking fat [ __ ] sweaty [ __ ] ugly
[ __ ] chopped [ __ ] get them away I don't want to see them cuz you have your
eyes on the prize and that's what being a profitable Trader is about it's about sifting weaving through the fat [ __ ]
and hitting that hitting that winning trade it's about sifting and in weaving
through all the bad trades not taking them not letting your horniness get the
best of you Tunnel Vision on the bad [ __ ] Tunnel Vision on the good trade
and taking that trade every single time but as we know profitable Traders we
have our flaws sometimes we take bad trades sometimes we got to get that nut off and
then we know exactly the mistakes that we made and we write them down in our post- trade Clarity and that is how how
you Journal your trades okay we need to journal our trades in order to understand our emotions in order to
understand our in order to understand our win rate and also to understand our risk reward
okay because over time you guys are going to be able to figure out what your average win rate is and what your average risk reward is and you're also
going to be figuring out damn every time I take a trade off of a order [ __ ] and
equilibrium or whatever every time I take a trade like this I [ __ ] lose
but every time I take a trade off of this I win huh it must not be a
coincidence write it down take a note of it and don't make the same mistake again now we have to get into the very last
piece of being a profitable Trader which is psychology and it's by far probably one of the at least for me it was the
hardest concept to get over and it was by far the hardest skill to grow within my trading and it and and it's one of the hardest skills to grow in life so
before you guys just think okay I'm said and done I know risk management I know strategy no you guys don't know it all
yet because trust me I knew risk management I knew strategy but the one thing that that took forever for me to
get over within my trading career was psychology so I don't like me personally
I can't let you guys go yet I know this video has been really [ __ ] long and thank you guys for sticking around okay
but I I really do need you guys to stay stay just a little bit longer so I can Grill you guys on your own psychology
right now you guys have horrible psychology ology right now and I can tell it even without being day Traders you guys have horrible
psychology okay and it is my goal to fix that and or at least give you guys the
tools to hopefully get over that really shitty Psychology okay so let's get into
this all right no more chart work just psychology work and this is probably
going to be one of either the most important lessons or you guys completely skip this lesson and you guys don't
learn [ __ ] and you guys just will not you just don't make it in day trading
just plain and simple so I guess what I'll do is I'll kind of first paint the
picture of uh where I was before trading and kind of like how I built myself up
to be where I'm at now so when I first started day trading for me I was very uh
like [ __ ] the system I mean as you guys saw from that little liquidity sweep mention on the monthly time frame you
know I'm I'm very against against the system that's just who I am I I hate being told what to do I just hate having
like the my biggest pet peeve was my parents telling me I couldn't do something or telling me what to do and me being pissed off like why do I have
to do this [ __ ] I don't want to do this [ __ ] I want to do what I want to do and to this day that's exactly how I am and
that's why I think trading and then also crypto enticed me was because this is is
such a [ __ ] this system game it's so like you know nobody can tell me nothing
because I'm making money in my own house on my own there's there's no other
variables and the only person to blame for a for a losing trade and the only person to blame for losing money is
myself so there's really no other factors to look towards or to point
towards when a trade is lost besides you should have done better you did
something wrong and I love that about trading where I was like okay this is awesome so the only person that matters
in this is myself that sounds a little bit narcissistic but you kind of do have to think that way where it's like okay
this is one I understood that it was the the scalability and The Leverage that this skill was going to be able to give
me I saw that and I understood if I can learn this skill I can make just
infinite amounts of money and the only thing that is limiting myself is me so
with that knowledge I was like okay all that all that I have to do is work on myself now work on what is required so I
need to understand how this strategy [ __ ] Works what what what causes the
markets to move and it took me a long time to figure that out luckily for you you guys you guys have a mentor like me
that's just giv given everything to you guys in one freaking video so you're welcome but back then I didn't have have
that I was going from YouTube channel to YouTube channel to YouTube channel trying to figure out like first of all
is this dude even [ __ ] legit like can I trust this person um because that's just the day and age that we live in and
then second of all not only can I trust this person but is what they are
teaching going to work for me and do they have everything necessary on their
YouTube channel for me to actually learn how to do this [ __ ] and it was just just
scrounging and scrounging and
scringy Graham okay I was reading all these different types of books I was watching all these videos and I probably
spent like there I I actually vividly remember the week that I that I got into day trading I I watched probably like 30
hours worth of YouTube so that's like essentially full-time that's like full-time job of YouTube of me learning
how to day trade and that was just the first week of me getting into it it it went way higher after that but I just
remember like looking back at like how like all the videos that I watched and I was like damn this is a lot I was just
that infatuated with it so after getting all the information and at the time
there was really nobody that was talking about psychology and mental discipline and emotional discipline within the
markets I was like awesome I know how to trade I or at at the time I thought I knew how to trade this thing and I went
in I deposited some money and what happened I lost all of it within the
first day and you're probably saying how is that even possible well I thought I knew how to trade and I tried to take
like literally 10 to 30 different trades in a single day and as you guys know now
that's not smart you guys should only be taking like one or two trades in a day because again if we're only if we're
risking 1 to 3% of our account per per day you know how how how much does that
even give us to work with not much right and also if we're only trading from 950 to 10:30 you know typically there's only
one setup that's going to happen within that time so I didn't have a mentor to tell me this stuff and I was looking for
trades 24/7 within the market I was looking for trades during Asian session I was looking for trades during London
session I was looking for trades during New York session and I was like what the [ __ ] man why is why is this not working
why are things not going in my favor I thought I did all this I I did all this research for nothing this thing's not working but I was still determined I was
like I I want this to work really bad because I know the potential that I that I can have in this I was just going and
going and going and I just kept losing these trades and then I figured out risk management and I was like okay cool I
know how much I'm supposed to risk per day so I I I wrote down I even have my
old notebook back when I was learning how to trade and look at this I have my trading plan written out right here this
is from way back in the day I had all the days that I was willing to trade um
you know I look at look at this right here risk 1 to 3% Max per trade so I
figured out risk management okay and I figured out this is like my strategy at the time this is [ __ ] by the way so
don't try and read the strategy and think it's good but I was writing down all these things that were going to be helpful for me to potentially get me to
the next level cuz I really wanted this [ __ ] I mean as you can see I was a little bit manic um you know I'm saying
calculate risk to reward before entering set up stop loss before entering don't
move your stop- loss back I was struggling I was struggling I was moving my stop- loss back because I was like no this trade has to go in my direction and
I was dealing with all of these emotions of greed of fear of
overconfidence of underconfidence and it was just this back and forth of like Euphoria despair Euphoria despair I
would hit a winning trade and I'll would be like what the [ __ ] this is the this is the greatest thing ever I'm going to be a billionaire and I'm going to take
three more trades and then lose the rest of those trades and then I'm back to despair mode and I'm like man I don't
think this is going to work and I'm sure if you guys have already been in trading for a little bit now you guys have
experienced these emotions before and this was just this this this constant cycle this constant cycle and and it
actually got to the point where I I got pretty good at trading where my strategy was pretty freaking solid I it got like
I mean my strategy now is more advanced than what it was at the time when I was first turning profitable or like getting
good at trading but it was kind of a variation of what I just taught you guys just a little bit uh a lot worse
actually but it was a variation of this of understanding the markets and uh my
risk management was on was on point to an extent there would still be those times or emotions with get the best of
me but for the most part I was like okay I understand where the Market's going to go like decently well where like I can
make pretty accurate predictions and honestly like my win rate was there it was at like 60 to 70% it was a pretty
solid win rate but my biggest issue man my big and worst issue was my emotions my emotions just kept getting the best
of me and there was a specific time where this will like I mean it haunts me
forever but it made me the trader that I am today I I had $10,000 in a trading
account and I turned that $10,000 into $112,000 over the span of two [ __ ]
days two days it took for me to go to $10,000 to $112,000 and I know every single one of you guys watching this
video is like holy [ __ ] I can do that too he's going to give me the secret to how I can do it guess what happened the
very next day I lost all of it I lost every single dollar the account balance
said zero you're probably saying the account got hacked brokerage ran off with your money
nope I lost all of the money day trading and it was because my emotions
got the best of me I was on this high rise of euphoria
I was thinking man life is good I'm winning these trades I keep making more
and more money with every single trade that I take I'm just going to keep increasing my risk because I can't stop
winning until the winning stopped that $112,000 would have changed my life like
literally forever but me losing that $112,000
changed my life even more than if I had kept that and it was the lessons that
losing that 12 $22,000 did to me that turned me into the trader that I am now and that was
the probably the worst period of life that I went through I like that $10,000
was literally all the money that I had um and it that loss caused me to go into
severe depression I tried to take my life and I know there's a lot of you guys that are
trying to get into day trading because you guys are not happy with your life right now and I can tell you right now I get emotional every single time that I
talk about this literally like I I feel like it's just rising up bro like I I hate crying on camera and [ __ ] and I've
done it before and it like I sometimes I can't help it but when I think back to this time God damn bro when I think back
to this time I was in such a shitty situation
sitation and there was nobody there to help me um I had a bad relationship with
my parents at the time um didn't really have a good relationship with my
siblings there and I I had no [ __ ] friends I was just like this nerd ass
dude at least like I just had this weird obsession with trading and I had nobody to [ __ ] talk to I had no money and I
was struggling really [ __ ] bad and at that point in time I was like I
just I hate my life so much I just want my life to be
over and that was like can't help myself from crying bro
cuz God damn bro like that [ __ ] worked
like I don't do this um
bro like I tried to take my life and I tried to take my life multiple times
and like it was I was in such a horrible place um I was I was in a horrible Place
mentally and I I just like I felt like nobody was there for me and like the one thing that I loved
just kind of let me down which was trading and I quit trading for 3 months
after that and like was just so depressed and was just in this like just
huge period of like what the [ __ ] am I on this Earth for like what like what the [ __ ] am I
doing and oh
man like I literally remember exactly where I was sitting when all this [ __ ] was going
through my head I feel like such [ __ ] oh I've
already done this sh before bro in a video and it
ah but I remember that exact position that I was sitting in when like all that [ __ ] was going through my head and like
I genuinely did not want to be on the earth anymore and I hated my life and I was just thinking like
man like I I just want to like figure out what the [ __ ] I'm supposed to
do and luckily for me like I had already been in crypto before and I had a decent
amount of money crypto and like there was just like that that 3 months was
horrible I I attempted to take my life I was in like dead um there was a point in
time where I had negative $2,000 in my bank account and I was literally like
bro I was [ __ ] door dashing like just trying to pay off that debt
and I was looking up all these different [ __ ] door Dash hacks like I would to make the most amount of money on door
Dash and I would bro like I I literally didn't have a [ __ ] life I was donating [ __ ] plasma and [ __ ] like it
and I'm sure a lot of you guys you guys are probably in that same exact position right now and man did life [ __ ] suck at
that point in time but crypto started picking back up and I couldn't help but
like look at the charts and I was looking at the crypto charts and I was like man like okay yeah like price is
going up I'm making some money that I had invested like a while ago like like
okay like things are kind of turning around and then I started drawing some chart some chart work up on the charts
and I'm like man like this is uh it kind of like brought some energy back in me and I was like starting to get happy
again and I was like man like what if I can actually make this [ __ ]
work what if you can actually make this [ __ ] work and that was just like the question
that like just kept running through my head bro and again I just like these are just like core [ __ ] memories in my
head like I I can like perfectly envision where I was sitting down when I was thinking these
things like literally on my [ __ ] trap ass iPad and I'm marking this [ __ ] up
and I'm like okay [ __ ] it like I I got to give this [ __ ] one more shot and the
biggest thing that losing that $112,000 gave me
was I I hit rock bottom and I just learned like I never want to go back to
that position ever again I never want to go back to that head space ever again and I'm happy when I'm day trading I'm
happy when I'm learning about this I'm happy when I'm doing it I'm happy right now I'm happy when I'm teaching it I I
[ __ ] love day trading probably more than like literally any I mean like I would like to say my love day trading is
more than the majority of people's um I love those goddamn charts so much they
saved my life and I like I just wanted to make make
this [ __ ] work so I told myself okay I know what not to do now I know not to be
over risking I know not to move my freaking stop loss I know to set my stop
loss before I enter I know to risk 1 to 3% Max per
trade okay and I I know to journal every
trade and I I mean even right here I review your losses screenshot your
trades before and after and put it in the spreadsheet like I I wrote all these things down and I um that was like the
turning point for me was just saying okay I really really [ __ ] want this
[ __ ] to work and I know a lot of you guys are probably in that position now and you know maybe you do have to hit
rock bottom to get it through your heads of what you are supposed to do and what
you're not supposed to do within the market like I had to but ideally I went through all that
suffering for you guys for you guys to learn from all the [ __ ] that I had to go
through because I didn't have a mentor like myself when I was when I started day trading and that's what I hope that
I could be for you guys like I was saying before I'm like my unprofitable self's favorite Mentor cuz these videos
would have hit so hard for him and hopefully they're doing the same for you so
that was like the head space that I was in going from I know strategy I know risk
management but my psychology is [ __ ] up and it's causing me to take bad trades it's causing me to over risk it's
causing me to move my stop- loss it's causing me to trade without a stoploss what the [ __ ] is wrong with me and then
I boom I get smacked in the [ __ ] face by life and by trading the markets are unforgiving they'll smack you in the
face and they'll take everything that you have if you aren't on top of your [ __ ] and I'm telling you this right the
[ __ ] now because I literally tried to take my life because of what the markets did to me more like what I did to myself
what my mental did to myself so you guys hopefully don't have to go through that and I'm going to lay out every single
thing mentally that I wish I knew before it happened to me so you
guys don't have to go through that same pain and that same suffering the first thing that I wish I did was just
developing emotional discipline and what does that even mean we as humans are just emotional ass creatures okay
typically when we act based off of emotion it's the wrong decision when we're acting based off of emotions we're
not acting based off a data we're not B acting based off of like the analytics and the data that is being given to us
we're acting based off of just the Fe like the feeling that it's making us if we're angry we we might punch someone if
we're sad like what whatever we're going to like be in a bad mood towards people
okay if we're greedy we're going to extend our take profit okay if we're fearful we might
not take that trade and more often than not when we listen
to our emotions and when we act based off of our emotions besides in relationships it's a stupid ass decision
or actually no I take that back even even more so in relationships we need to
be acting based off of data and analytics what is happening
what is in front of me what has happened and what should I do because of it not how am I feeling about this
situation cuz how you're feeling is going to cause you to take the take the wrong action how was I
feeling after I lost $112,000 that would have changed my
life the actions that I took after that were very poor decisions and were
emotional decisions super emotional decisions versus if I just went off based off the
data and said damn you're still a young ass kid you still you still understand this skill you got knocked down you can
get the you can get back up this isn't the end of the [ __ ] world you still got this bro I would have turned I would
have turned my [ __ ] around way quicker than the three months that it took for me to get up and get on the charts again
but I was making stupid emotional ass decisions and the same thing applies to trading if we lose a trade we can't get
pissed off and then try and go make that money back immediately no we have to learn from our loss and we have to Boom
take ourselves out of the market for that day understand that losses happen in trading and they're okay we should
welcome losses because it's a lesson for us to learn learn from that lesson and never make it again learn from that
mistake and never make it again oh damn I risked more than I should have okay that's okay did I lose more money than I
than I probably would have wanted yes but that's okay I'm going I that's fine it's a a little bit more money than I
would have liked to but guess what that's a learning experience and I'm never going to let that happen again and
because I'm never going to let that happened to me again that is going to cause me to make way more money than
that loss cost me if we're greedy when we extend take profits when we should have closed a trade position that should
have hit our takeprofit but we extended it because we wanted to make more money and then boom it hits our key level that
we should have taken profit on and price goes right back to your stop loss and you lose money you just paid for a
lesson bro you paid for a lesson in the market and you can sit you can cry and
you can immediately force yourself back into the market and you can look for another trade or you can say look I need
to understand that that was my one trade for the day I risked what I said I was
going to risk I lost because I let them my emotions get the best of me I took
actions based on my emotions because I'm emotionally attached to money we have to
emotionally detach ourselves from money if we think about trading as I'm not
looking to make money but I'm just looking to predict price action on a daily basis with high probability boom
you got it that is how you become a profitable day trader not how can I make
money today because if I go into the markets thinking how can I make money today I get into the markets and if I
lose money then my goal hasn't been completed and I'm going to keep trying keep trying keep trying until my goal has been completed but what's that going
to do that's going to leave me in the [ __ ] dirt cuz if I lose the first trade then that means I have to go back
and win a trade that's not only worth the loss of the first trade but also more than that so I can make my end goal
and what is that next trade going to lead me to do probably lose more money what's the trade after that going to do
probably lose more money and that's the exact lesson that I learned when I lost six [ __ ] figures so I'm telling you
guys right now don't let your emotions get the best of you the the emotions that you guys are going to deal deal
with are fear greed euphoria [ __ ] despair you guys are going to go
through Lo losing streaks and think man I can't get this [ __ ] I need to change my strategy [ __ ] no you don't have to
change your strategy you need to put in more work that's what you're lacking you're lacking the work and the
discipline to stick to the lessons that you already learn that in the mistakes that you keep making over and over and over and over and over and over over
again the second that you guys can stop making the same mistakes over and over again and the second that you guys have
the emotional discipline to say [ __ ] no to those lessons and [ __ ] no to those mistakes that's when you improve those
are that's when you crash through the brick wall and that's when you get to the next level there's mistakes and
there's problems at the next level just like I was telling you guys about but trust me those problems are the problems
that you got you are going to want to deal with I don't have to worry about the problem of being an unprofitable
Trader anymore I have to worry about the problem of how much money am I going to risk on this day how much money am I
willing to lose on this day is it going to be $155,000 is it going to be20 $5,000 is it going to be $10,000 is it
going to be $5,000 and I think back to when I was a unprofitable day trader oh
man I would have loved to be dealing with those problems that I'm dealing with now but you first have to overcome the problems at your level and the
problems that you guys are going to deal with is just these emotions bro they get the best of you and I'm telling you you
probably don't know it yet but you will when you get onto the charts and you take your first trade and you win and you get all amped up and you're like man
I want to take another one no you can't take another one you won on
the day you beat a market that 99% of people can't beat take your money and
leave you lost money on the day too bad so sad if you have a good win rate if
you have a good risk reward ratio you're net profitable why are you crying don't be butt hurt don't try and make money
every single day don't let your emotions get the best of you stick to your [ __ ] trading plan this is number two
number one emotional discipline learn to detach yourself from the money your goal
isn't to make money in trading your goal is to be right about where price wants to go if you can just be right about
where price wants to go boom you're set for life if you have that skill next one is sticking to your trading plan I just
went over the exact trading plan that you guys should be following if you guys can't stick to that and if you guys are
getting into trades before you guys should boom that's a discipline issue know where you're going to place your stop- loss know where you're going to
get in know where you're going to get out in both directions if if the trade starts going in the opposite direction
that I think I have to know exactly where I'm going to get out and I have to place a stop loss on with a price point
of saying I am going to lose this amount of money right here and that's where my trade idea gets invalidated and if it gets hit then there's no reason to even
look for another trade because my idea is gone my idea was wrong for the day
and the same thing if you enter into a trade and your idea is right you better [ __ ] get paid for it and you better
not let your emotions get the best of you for you trying to make more stick to your trading plan next one is managing
your fear and greed a lot of you guys it's it's funny because you guys
won't deal with this on demo but you guys will deal with this the second that you move to a live account if you guys are profitable on demo that's step one
step two is going from profitable on demo to profitable on a live account it's two different things because on
demo it's fake money who cares if you lose who cares if you win but on a live account that's your hard-earned money
that you've been working your ass off for so you care if you lose you care if you win but that's the problem you can't
care you can't care if you win you can't care if you lose you have to be emotionless and the problem is if you
care about when you lose you're going to be Fe fearful it's going to lead to hesitation in the market it's going to
lead to missed opportunities it's going to lead to you guys hovering over the buy button but you're just freaking out
because you're like man I don't want to lose this hundred bucks and then boom price goes in the direction that you
wanted it to go and would have hit all your take profits or green you guys may get greedy you guys win one
trade and you're like man I'm the best at this I'm going to take another one causes you to overtrade or you guys
extend your take profit or you just remove your take profit this trade's going up forever no it's not I can promise you it
is not going up forever take profits and get the [ __ ] out of the market the next
thing that you guys need to do is to control your imp impulses there are three fears that day Traders go go through
within the markets the fear of being wrong so fearful of being wrong that's
what leads to hesitation and that's what leads to miss opportunities the fear of losing money that also leads to
hesitation and that also leads to miss opportunities and last but not least fear of missing
out fear of missing out is a huge one especially in day trading let me try and
get this [ __ ] through your heads the market has been here for more years than
I have been alive and more years than you have been alive and there has been opportunities every single day to catch a trade that could change your life
ideally none of these trades change your life because then you're just shooting for the Stars ideally it's just multiple trades that gradually change your life
right but every single day for the entire the entirety of your guys' lives
has there been an opportunity within the market for you guys to execute and for you guys to make money on every single
day there has been opportunity so what makes you think if you miss the trade today if you missed that trade if you
missed out on that trade what makes you think that you have to go and try and
find another trade today because the Market's just going to disappear tomorrow you're never going to be able to make money ever again [ __ ] no never
have the fear of missing out the market will be here forever there's endless amounts of opportunities within this
Market there's opportunities today there's opportunities Tomorrow there's going to be opportunities months from
now there's going to be opportunities years from now there's going to be opportunities lifetimes from now so you
stressing over one single trade that you missed all your oh damn every single
step in my strategy or in every single step in tjr strategy got hit but I just didn't take the trade so now I'm going to force myself to look for another
trade because ah I just wish I took that trade no shut the [ __ ] up and go home you're done for the day and you better
wake up tomorrow morning ready to take that trade why didn't you take that trade in the first place you were fearful you were hesitant why did you
hesitate fix that fix these things and you will be a profitable Trader if you guys can handle
losses like a pro and handle losses like a lesson you guys will be profitable I can promise you that if you guys can
lose money and be unfaced by that knowing that wins are On Your Horizon and knowing that hey as long as
I keep good risk management my account it's not going to go down too crazy because I know I'm going to win trades
in the future I know that hey this little losing streak that I'm on right now it's not going to last forever and
I'm going to keep win be able to accept losses and move the [ __ ] on you got to think in
probabilities no profitable day trader is hidden okay 100% win rate it's
impossible nobody in the entire world has ever done that besides maybe one person who's taken one trade one and
then left forever but if we're talking about people who take trades on a daily basis there's nobody that has 100% win rate you have to be able to see losses
as a lesson you have to like encourage losses I like when I'm on a losing streak cuz it exposes my flaws I'm like
damn shouldn't have taken a trade here damn shouldn't have done this shouldn't have done that versus when I'm on a winning streak I think I'm invincible
and then that's when my emotions get the best of me the next thing that you guys need to do maintain a growth mindset
every time that you guys make a mistake every time that you guys make a lesson it's a it's room for growth Journal your
trades keep track of your emotions understand why you lost and if you can understand why you lost and you
understand the mistake that you made then ideally you never make that mistake again and at the end of the day like I
said for day trading is going to be really [ __ ] hard guys I I want to leave you
guys with a a a message here where like
this is just kind of my biggest piece of advice to you
guys and like kind of the last thing that I want to cover here before I let you guys go off okay there's one more
thing that I want to say after this but we'll we'll we'll we'll hit on this first and especially if you guys have
made it this far congratulations I I truly do believe in you and even more on
that if you guys got this far in this video not only do I know that you are similar to me when I was first
starting but I also know that you guys are probably in a similar head space that I was when I was first starting you
guys are probably a little bit different than everybody else you guys want to make money
online and that's different most people say yeah I I'm going to go to college
I'm going to get a get a job and I'm going to please my parents and that's going to be it I'm going to work 95 and
that's it you guys are different you guys were willing to sit through multiple hourong YouTube video learning
about day trading which is a skill set that 97% of people fail at that's the
99% of people fail at that's a brutally honest truth but you guys were still
willing to sit through this entire video that that tells me that you guys are
delusional that tells me that you guys are [ __ ] crazy and I can tell you this much I know damn well when I was
learning how to trade and I watched a video similar to this it wasn't nearly as [ __ ] good but when I watched a
video similar to this similar to this it was two hours long and it taught me all the basics
about trading when I finished it I just wanted more and I can tell you right now
if you guys have that feeling inside of your chest saying godamn I wish this video didn't
end I just want to learn more and more and more about this awesome skill you guys have that [ __ ] in you you guys can
make this work if you guys have that hunger and if you guys have that desire and if you guys have that delusion of
I'm going to make this work no matter [ __ ] what then I can promise you guys
there is light at the end of the tunnel you're going to be in the dark for so long and I don't want to say that to
scare you if anything I want to say that to encourage you because as you're as
you're in that tunnel there's going to be people that turn the [ __ ] around they get through this video say man they
after their first week the shit's not working for me I'm going home after their first month this shit's not
working for me I'm going the [ __ ] home I was at this [ __ ] for two [ __ ]
years straight relentlessly rid wrting down my trading plan writing down these
affirmations telling myself I will make $10,000 in a month I am successful I
will invest money into crypto I'm successful in the markets I make money in the markets I'm not greedy I'm un
buan I'm I'm confident in my markups and my in my layouts my mindset is always leveling up I was writing this [ __ ] down
I will follow my trading plan I will follow my schedule I will log my trades I was writing all of this [ __ ]
down before I was that man before I turned into that person because I was so
delusional about my own success I was so delusional about where I knew day trading could take me and I know for a
fact every single one of you guys ideally has that in you or I know for a fact that every single one of you guys
watching this video right now has the potential in you but you have to have that will and that desire and that
delusion that [ __ ] Mania in your head that says I do not want to I do not want
to be [ __ ] normal and that was my problem that was why I was so depressed that was why I was so sad that was why I
felt so weird that was why I felt so [ __ ] self-conscious was because I thought in my head why am I not normal
why do I want to learn this dumbass online money [ __ ] so [ __ ] bad why can't I just be
normal why can't I just go through college learn all the same [ __ ] and just get a job and make my parents happy
my parents bro my parents asked me over and over and over again to stop day trading because I was losing money they
were getting notifications from from the bank that they were [ __ ] connected to saying hey your son's got a negative
balance again hey your son's balance is at zero again bro the amount of [ __ ]
times that I got a text message from my mom or my dad saying your bank's at zero
there's negative balance in your account and then and then and then them following up with are you still trading
them calling me saying you need to stop day TR in you need to stop this and me
lying to them over the phone and saying okay I'm done the very next day what am I doing
right back on the charts I wish I could have been normal but that [ __ ] wasn't for me and I can tell you guys right [ __ ] now if you guys are thinking
that this is possible or if you guys just have the slightest the slightest hope bro I can tell you for a fact that
this is possible and I like you guys are probably thinking I just want to make
$10,000 a month in trading bro it's it's going to be so much more
than that it's going to be so so much more than $110,000 a month it's going to
be 20 it's going to be 30 it's going to be 50 it's going to be $100,000 a month as long as you guys keep that drive as
long as you guys keep that ambition and I I wish I had a mentor
that was like I don't know when I was learning how to trade there there just wasn't anybody that like
I don't know there there straight up wasn't anybody that was like as passionate about this [ __ ] as me I guess
um and it like set me off I was like man why don't these people love this [ __ ] as much as me and hopefully now I can be
your guys' light like yo I'm a like you guys may see me as a [ __ ] cool guy
I'm going doing regular [ __ ] in my Vlogs and whatever but when it comes to this chart [ __ ] like man I'm a [ __ ] nerd
bro like back in the day if I were to tell anybody like yeah bro trying to get into day trading they're like bro what
the [ __ ] are you talking about and and hopefully I can bring up this next this
new generation of traders that like really truly want to make it in trading
and that's my goal not only with YouTube but with everything else like my
Instagram my Tik Tok my [ __ ] day trading blueprint like where I can
actually coach you guys where you guys can ask me [ __ ] questions and I can actually like like got man I [ __ ] I
[ __ ] wish I had a mentor that God [ __ ] damn it bro I wish I had a mentor that was willing to do that type
of [ __ ] for me and here I am willing to do this [ __ ] for you guys
like bro it's I I like I I am the mentor that
unprofitable me just like [ __ ] wish he had so [ __ ] bad and I can promise
you guys that bro just if you guys can put your faith in me put your trust in
me I I am going to take and I'm going to do everything in in my power to help you guys get to get to become a profitable
Trader without a doubt in my mind and there's going to be a time where you guys have to let me go as a mentor and
there's some people that have been on been on here and followed my journey for long enough I've been on here for like
damn near 2 and a half years now bro it's been a while where I've been posting trading videos strategy videos
like pschology videos for a while now and uh you know people are like yeah I I
no longer need you as a mentor but that's what I'm here for as sad and as
as weird as it sounds like you guys are here to use me for what I am I'm a
bridge for you guys to cross and there's a [ __ ] rapid ass river that I had to
get [ __ ] up by in order to get to the other side but I built a bridge for you guys and my goal as a mentor is to be
your guys' Bridge from unprofitable not knowing [ __ ] about day trading to being profitable knowing everything there is
to know about day trading and once you guys get over the bridge there's no use for the bridge anymore and I'm
completely satisfied with that because I know that if I'm able to help you guys
get there and and actually like make your wildest dreams come true that's
what makes me happy if I can get you guys to your goals and that that's all
that younger me want wanted bro younger me just wanted a mentor that is [ __ ]
willing to give him all all the knowledge that he has willing to get on
[ __ ] calls with him and [ __ ] willing to like [ __ ] just Co coach him
through specific questions and
like I I really can't even imagine what my life would be like if I had myself as a mentor back in the day and and I
appreciate you guys for being on my team and and watching through this this whole
video and uh on that note again I I went
through a whole bunch of confluences I went through a whole bunch of [ __ ] within this video not only is it not
necessarily enough to like fully turn you profitable in trading I really wish
this this this video like was the the the the one and only only piece to get you guys there but like deep down I just
know it's not um it it's definitely like in it's an insane amount of information
but uh there's there's just so much more info out there and just so many minute details that I just am not able to cover
or else this video would literally be like 50 hours long and if you guys want
that sort of information that sort of coaching that sort of mentorship where like you guys really do get literally
everything like way more in depth on those confluences that I talked about way more in depth on the strategy that I
talked to you guys about way more in depth on psychology way more in depth on risk management like literally how to
calculate exactly what percentage you should be risking per trade depending on
your win rate depending on what your risk reward is like the numbers that I gave you guys are just like estimates
right like the goal is just to at least push like just push the masses in the
right direction but I can't sculpt you guys as a Trader and what I want to offer to you guys is to be able to
actually do that and that's pretty much what my day trading blueprint is and
there's a little Link in the description if you guys want to be fully coached by me for like lit like literally get hand
[ __ ] sculpted by myself like this video times a thousand because not only
are you going to be learning these confluences again but better you're going to be learning more confluences you guys are going to be learning more
about the markets you guys are going to be learning like there's there's so much more that I could have expanded on that
it like this video would literally just be endless and all of that is within the day trading blueprint and on top of that
you guys get on a daily coaching call with me and other coaches where we go
over trade reviews so like right now boom you guys take your first freaking trade using this strategy and you're
like God damn it I suck what did I do wrong you probably don't know what the [ __ ] you did wrong but if you take it to
me or one of my other coaches they're going to be like yeah bro you're a dumbass you mark that fair value Gap
incorrectly and you're like ah [ __ ] I forgot those are those are questions that I wish I had answered for myself
that would have bridge the gap for me so much quicker that instead of having to sift through YouTube video YouTube video
YouTube video YouTube video and being like oh [ __ ] I did this wrong oh [ __ ] I'm doing this wrong and just keeping
everything in check like if I could get on a coaching call every single day with profitable Traders I mean like such as
myself oh my God like the the speedrun to profitability is [ __ ] insane like
there are literally people that go from knowing nothing about trading who go through this program and get
funded and turn into a profitable Trader literally two months later I'm not even
joking pop literally pop up the testimonial of somebody who didn't know [ __ ] and then 2 months later they're
they're a profitable Trader passing a funded account so I'm I like look I gave
you a a whole bunch of information here by all means I'm not telling you guys that you guys need to go out of your way
and buy my [ __ ] coaching but I but I am saying that you guys will get
infinitely farther after watching this video and then coming into my coaching
then if you guys just watch this video and then try and grind grind grind and do it on your own because we as coaches
myself I know ex the exact position that you were in and all these other
profitable traders that are in there with me to help teach you and sculpt you as a Trader know the exact position that
you are in know the exact mistakes that you guys are probably making so when you guys come to us and you're like hey I
have a question we're literally just like stop bro I know what you're going to say you're wrong don't do this do
that move on with your day and you're like wa thank the Lord and it's just like it it it just brings so much mental
Clarity to trading where before like for me I would just I would just get in
there and it's like okay well that like [ __ ] I lost the trade and I don't know
[ __ ] why I think I marked all my confluences out correctly I think I took the right trade I just don't know why I
lost is this a day that I should have just scrapped up to the market being bad or did I actually do something wrong I
didn't have those questions to get answered but you guys have that opportunity to get questions answered
you guys can literally send us a picture of your trade and be like what did I do wrong here did I mark this Confluence
out incorrectly was I supposed to trade at this time what did I do incorrectly and
that it's like boom this this this this was great this was good don't do this
again dumbass why the [ __ ] would you take this and then boom patch patch
patch patch and you're over that over all of those mistakes that you probably wouldn't have even known were mistakes
from the jump if if you if you didn't have us there so again by all means
there's a at the end of the day there's there's literally all free education
everywhere across the entire internet right we we know that like at the end of the day the internet has literally every
piece of information known to man right so yeah you could say I I just want to
you know learn day trading on my own and and just go through these videos that like that's fine by me that's how I did
it it was [ __ ] The Trenches it took me 2 years to do it but I do think that
I can be a huge [ __ ] service to you and your profitable Journey as a day trader and also just me understanding
who you are as a person and understanding where you're at as a Trader and also all these other profitable traders who are actually even
more similar to you than I am to you because you guys probably see me as like oh this guy's this guy's Rich he's got
all the money in the world he doesn't even know what it's like to be in my my position anymore it's like no I do but there are people that have been
profitable for like just one year now and and have just got out of that exact same position that you guys are in right
the [ __ ] now and they're in there to help you as well so if you guys want
that and also also this the sad thing is the spots are super limited so like I'm
assuming there's going to be a whole bunch of people like trying to get in it after this video which like by all means
is great but there's only certain types of people that I want to let in clearly off this video I don't want to let you
in if you're going to be lazy and if you're not willing to put in the work you have to be delusional you have to be [ __ ] crazy about this [ __ ] you have
to be really willing to get like really [ __ ] willing to be a professional day
trader like I want to ideally see a mini version of me within that interview and
within that application and if I can't see that mini version of me within that application then just straight up like
you guys aren't going to get let in and I know that sounds rude and that sounds mean but if if you aren't the Mini
version of me then by all means just like whatever take advantage of my YouTube videos but I'm telling you that I I don't waste
my time on people that I don't see potential in and I hope that I can see
potential in every single one of you guys but you guys have to prove that to me that that that's like the very first
thing it's like I'm not just going to let in any and everybody that just says like yeah just make make me Rich right
now I don't even care about this trading thing I just want to like no bro you're not going to get let in if I can see that you guys are truly passionate about
this [ __ ] and it and it and if it's actually worth my time to be coaching you then we will give you guys the
opportunity to join and again I know that there's going to be a whole bunch of applications after this video goes
out and there's going to be a whole bunch of people that are trying to join so we we might have closed uh closed the
applications uh after you guys are seeing this video if that's the case just join the wait list and you guys
will be on there and and maybe we'll reach out to you guys when the time comes but if you guys do get the chance
to be able to actually apply and be able to get interviewed don't take that [ __ ]
for granted because I actually do see something in you I see my younger unprofitable self in you and I want to
give you guys the chance to be able to turn profitable at a much quicker pace so I really do appreciate you guys if
you guys want to join the day trading blueprint there's going to be a link in the description we just dropped a whole bunch of [ __ ] game on your guys'
heads I hope hope you guys took a lot from this and again if you guys want to join the day trading blueprint and be
like all of these other testimonials that are flashing all over the screen right now or like if you guys even want
to see even more testimonials I have three testimonial highlights all over my story we literally average four and a
half funded accounts pass per day in the day trading blueprint meaning there are
four and a half funded accounts getting passed every single day that are getting sent into the success chat and yes that
is being tracked and that is being averaged out by the amount of traders that we have in there and that's [ __ ]
ridiculous so for us to be able to produce that type of results we not only need a good coach but we also need a
good student so with that being said I really appreciate you guys if you guys want to join the day trading blueprint
hopefully I see you guys in there if not I'll see you guys in the comments if not I hope you guys can at least subscribe
I'll catch you guys in the next one peace the [ __ ] out
