"""
Coordinate Finder Utility

This script is a simple helper tool to determine the coordinates of a rectangular
region on the screen. It prompts the user to position their mouse at the top-left
and bottom-right corners of the desired area and then calculates the region's
position and size.

The output is a tuple in the format (left, top, width, height), which is exactly
what the `region` parameter in the `DevysAutomation` module functions requires.

How to Use:
1.  Run the script from your terminal:
    python find_coord.py

2.  Follow the on-screen instructions:
    -   First, move your mouse to the top-left corner of the desired region.
    -   Wait for 5 seconds.
    -   Next, move your mouse to the bottom-right corner of the region.
    -   Wait for another 5 seconds.

3.  The script will print the final `(left, top, width, height)` tuple.

4.  Copy this tuple and paste it as the `search_region` value in your main
    automation script (e.g., `AutoWork.py`).
