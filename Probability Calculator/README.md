# Probability Calculator

This Python script calculates the number of runs required and the total time needed to achieve a target success probability based on a given drop chance and mission time. It allows you to input your target success chance, drop chance, and mission time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) to estimate how many runs and how much time it will take to achieve your desired success rate.

## Features
- Calculates the number of runs required to achieve a target success chance.
- Computes the total time needed based on mission time and number of runs.
- Validates input values and provides error messages for invalid inputs.
- Provides results in a user-friendly format with color-coded output using `colorama`.
